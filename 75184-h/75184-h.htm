<hr class="r10a">

<p class="p2 noindent">The collection of <span class="smcap">Pythagoric Fragments</span>
contained in this volume must be
considered by every one as highly valuable
if their antiquity only is regarded; but by
the lover of genuine wisdom they will be
deemed inestimable, as proceeding from
the school of the father of philosophy.</p>

<p>Of the greater part of the authors of these
fragments little more than the country in
which they lived is known. But of Charondas,
and Zaleucus, those celebrated legislators,
Seneca in his 90th Epistle informs
us that they learnt their laws in the silent
and sacred recess of Pythagoras. Though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">[vi]</span>
Seneca, however, Diodorus Siculus, Diogenes
Laertius, Porphyry, and Iamblichus
make both Charondas and Zaleucus to be
the disciples of Pythagoras; yet Dr. Bentley,
in his Dissertation on Phalaris, seems
more disposed to think that they were not
Pythagoreans than that they were. At the
conclusion, however, of his discussion of
this subject he says, “I do not assert any
thing positively on either side of this whole
debate about the two lawgivers [Charondas
and Zaleucus]. I rather desire to stand
a neuter, till the matter shall be decided
by some abler hand<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.” But the man of
intellect who reads this concession of the
doctor, will doubtless laugh when he finds
him also asserting, “Thus much I am sure
may be safely concluded, that if Zaleucus
was really Pythagoras’ disciple, the learned
Mr. Dodwell’s calculation must be wrong
[respecting the age of Pythagoras]. For<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vii">[vii]</span>
which is more probable, that a Mr. Dodwell
was mistaken in this particular, or that
Diodorus Siculus, Laertius, Porphyry, and
Iamblichus were wrong, who lived so many
centuries prior to him, and who were able
to derive information so much more decisive
respecting Zaleucus, through books
which were then extant, but which have
long since utterly perished? By Vossius<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
however, who, though he was not perhaps
so great a verbal critic as Bentley, was certainly
a man of more intellect<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
of these fragments were considered as precious
monuments; and he wonders, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
at the same time indignant, at their not
being more frequently perused.</p>

<p>Of Hierocles, the author of the <span class="smcap">Ethical
Fragments</span>, something more is known
than of the authors of the <span class="smcap">Political
Fragments</span>, through what is said of him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
by Suidas, Damascius<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, and Æneas Gazæus.
For from the last of these we learn that he
flourished about the end of the fifth century
of the Christian era; and from the other
two, that he was a Platonic philosopher of
Alexandria: that his conceptions were
magnificent, and his genius sublime; that
he was very eloquent, astonished his auditors
by the beauty and copiousness of his
language, and contended with Plato himself
in elegance of diction, and fertility of
intellect. One of his auditors was Theosebius,
a man of great penetration, who at
different times twice heard Hierocles orally
explaining the Gorgias of Plato; and
though on comparing the latter with the
former explanation, he found nothing in
the one which might be said to be the same
with what was in the other, yet each of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span>
them unfolded as much as possible the intention
of Plato in that dialogue—which,
as Damascius well observes, was a thing of
a most singular nature, and clearly demonstrates
the amplitude of his conceptions.
We are informed, also, by the same Theosebius,
that Hierocles once said, when
expounding Plato, that the discourses of
Socrates<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> resembled cubes, because they
remained firm wherever they might fall.</p>

<p>The following circumstance, says Suidas,
evinces the fortitude and magnanimity of
Hierocles. On coming to Byzantium, he
offended the <em>prevailers</em> (<span lang="grc">προσεκρουσε τοις Κρατουσι</span>)
i.e. <em>the Christians</em><a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>; and being brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span>
into a court of justice by them was whipped.
But while the blood was flowing, he took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span>
some of it in the hollow of his hand, and
besprinkled with it the judge, at the same
time exclaiming:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Cyclops, since human flesh is thy delight,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Now drink this wine<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Being banished, most probably in consequence
of this magnanimous behaviour;
and returning some time after to Alexandria,
he gave philosophical lectures to his
auditors in his usual manner. Suidas adds,
that the grandeur of the conceptions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>
Hierocles may be learnt from the perusal of
his Commentaries On the Golden Verses
of the Pythagoreans, and from his treatise
On Providence<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; in which works it appears
that he was sublimely wise in his life,
but not accurate in his knowledge. Damascius
also says, that Hierocles was not
at all deficient in any thing pertaining
to merely human science, but that he was
by no means replete with <em>blessed conceptions</em>,
i.e. with conceptions which are the
offspring of an <em>entheastic</em>, or divinely inspired
energy; and which are to be found
in abundance in the writings of Plato, Plotinus,
Iamblichus, Proclus, and Damascius
himself. This, indeed, will be immediately
evident<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> to the man who has penetrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span>
the depth of these writings, but to the merely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span>
verbal critic is a circumstance involved in
Cimmerian darkness.</p>

<h3 id="h1">FROM THE TREATISE OF HIPPODAMUS THE
THURIAN ON A REPUBLIC.</h3>

<p class="noindent">I say that the whole of a polity is divided into
three parts. And one part, indeed, consists
of good men, who manage the public affairs.
But the second part consists of those who are
powerful. And the third part is composed of
those who are employed in supplying and procuring
the necessaries of life. I denominate,
however, the first multitude [in a polity] that
which consults [for the good of the whole]; the
second, that which is auxiliary; and the third,
that which pertains to mechanical and sordid
occupations. Of these also, I say that the two
first belong to those whose condition in life is
liberal; but the third, to those who labour to
procure subsistence. And of these indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
that which consults is the best; but that which
is employed in sordid occupations is the worst;
and that which is auxiliary, is a medium between
the two. That which consults likewise
[for the general good] ought to govern; but
that which is engaged in sordid occupations
ought to be governed: and that which is auxiliary
ought both to govern and be governed.
For that which consults for the general good
previously deliberates what ought to be done;
but that which is of an auxiliary nature, so far
as it is belligerent, rules over the whole of the
mechanical tribe; but so far as it antecedently
receives counsel from others, is itself governed.</p>

<p>Of these parts, however, each again receives
a triple division. For of that which consults,
one part presides, another governs, and another
counsels for the general good. And with respect
to the part which presides, it is that
which plans, contrives, and deliberates about
what pertains to the community, prior to the
other parts, and afterwards refers its counsels
to the senate. But the governing part is either
that which now rules [for the first time], or
which has before performed that office. And
with respect to the third part, which consults
for the general good, this receives the advice of
the parts prior to itself, and confirms by its
suffrages and authority whatever is referred to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
its decision. And, in short, it is requisite that
those who preside should refer the affairs of
the community to that part which consults for
the general good; but that this latter part
should refer these affairs through the Prætors
to the Convention.</p>

<p>In a similar manner also of that part which
is auxiliary, powerful, and efficacious, one part
is of a governing nature; another part is defensive;
and the remaining, which is the greater
part, is gregal and military. It is the governing
part, therefore, from which the leaders of
armies, the præfects of cohorts, the bands of
soldiers, and the vanguards are derived, and
universally all those who rank as leaders. But
the whole genus of the vanguards consists of
those that are most brave, most impetuous,
and most daring. And the remaining multitude
is gregarious and military. Of the third
part, however, which is engaged in sordid occupations,
and in labouring to procure the necessaries
of life, one part consists of husbandmen,
and those who are employed in the elaboration
of the land; but another part consists of artificers,
who procure such instruments and machines
as the occasions of life require; and
another part is engaged in peregrinations and
merchandise, and in exporting to foreign regions
such things as are superabundant in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
city, and importing into it other things from
foreign countries. The systems of political
society, therefore, are coarranged through so
many and such like parts.</p>

<p>In the next place, it is requisite to speak of
their adaptation and union. Since, however,
the whole of political society may be perfectly
assimilated to a lyre, in consequence of requiring
apparatus and coaptation, and also because
it is necessary that it should be touched and
used musically;—this being the case, I have
sufficiently spoken above about the apparatus
of a polity, and shown from what and from how
many particulars it is constituted. I shall now,
therefore, endeavour to speak of the coaptation
and union of these. I say then, that political
society is coadapted from the following three
particulars, from disciplines, the study of manners
[or customs], and from the laws; and that
through these three, man is instructed, and becomes
more worthy. For disciplines are the
sources of erudition, and cause the desires to
be impelled to virtue. But the laws, partly detaining
by fear, repell men [from the commission
of crimes,] and partly alluring by honours
and gifts, excite them [to virtue]. And manners
and studies fashion the soul like wax, and
through their continued energy impress in it
propensities that become, as it were, natural.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
It is necessary, however, that these three should
have an arrangement in conjunction with the
beautiful, the useful, and the just; and that
each of these three should, if possible, have all
these for its final intention; but if not all of
them, it should at least have two or one of
them as the mark at which it aims, in order
that disciplines, manners, and laws may be
beautiful, just, and advantageous. In the first
place, however, the beautiful in conduct should
be preferred; in the second place the just; and
in the third place, the useful. And universally
the endeavour should be, that through
these the city may become, in the most eminent
degree, consentaneous and concordant
with its parts, and may be free from sedition
and hostile contention. But this will be effected,
if the passions in the souls of youth are
disciplined, and in things pleasing and painful
are led to mediocrity, and if the possessions of
men are moderate, and they derive their subsistence
from the cultivation of the earth.
And this will also be accomplished, if good
men rule over those that are in want of virtue;
skilful men over those that are deficient in
skill; and rich men over those things that require
a certain largess and expenditure; and
if also appropriate honours are distributed to
those who govern in all these in a becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
manner. But there are three causes which are
incitements to virtue, viz. fear, desire, and
shame. The law, however, is able to produce
fear, but custom shame: for those that have
been accustomed to act well, will be ashamed
to do any thing that is base. And disciplines
are capable of producing desire. For they at
one and the same time assign the causes of
things, and attract the soul, and they especially
effect this when they are accompanied
with exhortation. Hence it is necessary that
the souls of young men should be sufficiently
instructed in what pertains to senates, fellowship,
and associations, both military and political,
but that the tribe of elderly men should be
coadapted to things of this kind; since young
men, indeed, require correction and instruction,
but elderly men are in want of benevolent
associations, and a mode of living unattended
with pain.</p>

<p>Since, therefore, we have said, that the worthy
man is perfected through three things, viz.
through customs, laws, and disciplines, it is
requisite to consider how customs or manners
are usually corrupted, and how they become
permanent. We shall find, then, that customs
are corrupted in two ways: for they are either
corrupted through ourselves or through foreigners.
And through ourselves, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
either through our flying from pain, or through
our pursuit of pleasure. For in consequence
of flying from pain, we do not endure labour;
and through our pursuit of pleasure, we reject
what is good. Labours, however, procure
good for mankind; but pleasures evil. Hence
men through pleasures, becoming incontinent
and remiss, are rendered effeminate in their
souls, and more profuse in their expenses.
But customs and manners are corrupted
through foreigners, when a multitude of these
dwelling with us, rejoice in the success of
their emporetic employment; or when those
who dwell in the suburbs, being lovers of pleasure
and luxury, impart their manners to the
neighbouring inhabitants. On this account it
is necessary that the legislators, and prefects
of the mass of the people, should diligently observe
whether the customs of the city are carefully
preserved, and proceed equally through
all the citizens. And farther still, they should
observe whether the genuine and indigenous
multitude, of which the polity consists, remains
pure and unmingled with any other nation;
and whether the magnitude of possessions remains
in the same state, and does not become
excessive. For the possession of superfluities
is accompanied by the desire of still more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
of the superfluous. After this manner, therefore,
customs ought to be rendered secure.</p>

<p>With respect to disciplines, however, the
same legislators and præfects should diligently
inspect and examine the tribe of sophists, whether
they teach what is useful to the laws, to
political dogmas, and to the peculiar economy
of life. For the doctrines of the sophists ingenerate
in the souls of men, no casual but the
greatest infelicity; when they dare to make innovation
in any thing pertaining either to human
or divine concerns, contrary to common conceptions;
than which nothing can be more pernicious
either with respect to truth, or security,
or renown. And in addition to this, also,
they introduce darkness and confusion into
the minds of the vulgar. But of this kind are
all such doctrines as either teach that there is
no God, or if there is, that he is not so affected
towards the human race, as to look to it with
providential attention, but deserts and despises
it. For doctrines of this kind produce in men
folly and injustice, to an extent which it is not
easy to narrate. For every man who is full of
anarchy, and who has shaken off the fear of
disobedience [to rulers and the laws], wantonly
exults, and violates the laws. Hence it is
necessary to employ political and venerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
assertions, which are adapted to the disposition
of the speaker, and which are void of dissimulation.
For thus what is said will exhibit the
manners of the speaker. From the laws, however,
security will thus be necessarily introduced,
if the polity is composed and coarranged
from every thing which is according to
nature, and not from such things as are preternatural.
For cities derive no advantage
from a tyranny, and very little from an oligarchy.
It is necessary, therefore, that a kingdom
should be established in the first place; and in
the second place, an aristocracy. For a kingdom,
indeed, is a thing imitative of God, and
which is with difficulty preserved and defended
by the human soul. For it is rapidly changed
through luxury and insolence. Hence it is not
proper to employ it universally, but only so far
as it may be useful to the polity; but an aristocracy
should be more abundantly interwoven
in it, because it consists of many rulers, who
emulate each other, and who often alternately
govern. It is also entirely necessary that a democracy
should be introduced. For as a citizen
is a part of the whole polity, it is requisite
that he should receive a certain reward from it<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
But it is necessary that he should be sufficiently
restrained. For the vulgar are audacious
and precipitate.</p>


<h3 id="h2">FROM THE TREATISE OF DIOTOGENES ON
SANCTITY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is necessary that the laws should not be
enclosed in houses, and by gates, but in the
manners of the citizens. What, therefore, is
the principle of every polity? The education of
youth. For vines will never bear useful fruit,
unless they are well cultivated; nor will horses
ever become excellent, if colts are not properly
trained. For recently produced fruit receives
a figure especially similar to that which touches
and is near to it. And men prudently attend to
the manner in which vines ought to be cut and
taken care of; but in things pertaining to the
education of their own species, they conduct
themselves negligently and rashly; though neither
vines nor wine govern men, but man and
the soul of man. And we commit the nurture
of a plant, indeed, to a man of some worth, and
think that he who takes care of it, deserves no
less than two mina; but we commit the education<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
of youth to some Illyrian or Thracian,
who are men of no worth. The first legislators,
however, as they could not render the middle
class of mankind stable, adjoined [in their education]
dancing and rhythm, which participate
of motion alone and order; and besides these
they added sports, some of which exhorted
them to fellowship, but others to truth and
mental acuteness. In a similar manner also
they instituted for those who through intoxication
or repletion had committed any crime, the
pipe and harmony, by which they gave an arrangement
to the mind, so that the manners
being matured and rendered mild, they might
be capable of being adorned.</p>


<h3 id="h3">FROM THE TREATISE OF ARCHYTAS ON LAW
AND JUSTICE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">I say that every [political] association consists
of a governor and the governed; and of a
third thing, viz. the laws. Of laws, however,
one is animated, viz. a king; but another inanimate,
viz. written law. The first law, therefore,
is animated<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>; and if it is observed, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
king will be legitimate; the magistrate will be
consentaneous; the subject will be free; and
the whole community will be happy. But if
both the animated and written laws are transgressed,
the king will be a tyrant; the magistrate
unfit for his office; the subject a slave;
and the whole community unhappy. For actions
form a continued series from governing,
the being governed, and, in the third place,
from subjugation. To govern, therefore, is the
province of that which is more, but to be
governed, of that which is less excellent, and
to be subjugated, pertains to both these. For
that part of the soul which is rational governs,
the part which is irrational is governed, and
both are vanquished by the passions. For
virtue is produced from the apt conjunction
of both these parts; and she leads the soul
from pleasures and pains to tranquillity and
apathy<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>.</p>


<h3 id="h4">AND IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SAME WORK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It will be beneficial to the community, if law
is not monarchical, and advantageous [only] to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
a private individual, but if it is generally useful,
and extends to every one. But it is also
necessary that the law should look to the
whole region, and to the different places in it.
For neither is the earth able to receive the same
fruits [every where] nor the soul of every man
the same virtue<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>.</p>


<h3 id="h5">IN ANOTHER PART ALSO OF THE SAME WORK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">But it is necessary that the more excellent
law and the city should be composed of every
other polity, and should have something of a
democracy, of an oligarchy, of a kingdom, and
of an aristocracy; as is the case in Lacedæmon.
For the kings there are monarchs; the elders
form an aristocracy; the ephori an oligarchy;
and the ippagretæ<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> and the young men a democracy.
It is necessary, however, that law
should not only be good and beautiful, but that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
it should also reciprocate in its parts: for thus
it will be strong and stable. But when I say
it should reciprocate, I mean that the same
magistrate should alternately govern and be
governed, as in Lacedæmon, in which there are
the most equitable laws. For there the ephori
are opposed to the kings, the elders to the
ephori, and the media between these are the
young men, and the ippagretæ; for these last
both incline to those <ins class="corr" id="tn-14" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'rulers that excell'">
rulers that excel</ins> in power, and are in subjection to others.</p>

<p>It is necessary that the law should, in the
first place, establish what pertains to the gods,
to dæmons and parents, and, in short, to what
is beautiful and honourable. But in the second
place, it should establish what pertains to
things that are useful. For it is fit that minor
concerns should be subsequent to such as are
greater. Nor should the laws be contained in
houses and gates, but in the manners of the
citizens. For neither in Lacedæmon, which
possesses the most excellent laws, is the city
governed by a multitude of writings, but rather
by the manners of the subjects. But it will be
beneficial to the community, if law is not monarchical,
and advantageous [only] to a private
individual, but if it is generally useful, and extends
to every one; and if it refers punishment
to disgrace and ignominy, and not to the loss of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
property. For by punishing with disgrace, the
citizens will endeavour in the most decorous and
useful manner, to avoid the punishment ordained
by the laws. But if the punishment is pecuniary,
the citizens will value money immoderately,
and will conceive it to be the greatest remedy
of crimes. It will be best, therefore, for the
whole city to be so arranged that it may not
be in want of any thing external, either with
respect to virtue or power, or any other cause.
For thus the body, a family, and an army will
be beautifully constituted, when each of these
has the cause of safety in itself, and does not
derive it externally. And this, indeed, will be
the case with the body when it is strong, with
a family when it is well composed, and with
an army which neither consists of mercenaries,
nor is unexercised. For these, when thus constituted,
will be far more excellent than others,
and will be free indeed, and foreign from every
thing of a servile nature; and will not, for the
purpose of endurance, be in want of many
things, but of a few, and those easily procured.
For thus he who is strong will not sink under
burdens, and he who is thinly clothed will
vanquish cold; since men are exercised by
casualties and calamities. Indeed, to the man
who is temperate, and who has laboured much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
both in body and soul, all meat and drink will
appear to be agreeable; and a bed composed
of leaves will be pleasant; but to him who
has deliberately chosen a luxurious and Sybaritic
life, even the apparatus of the great [or Persian]
king would not be sufficiently pleasing.
Hence it is necessary that the manners and
pursuits of the citizens should be deeply tinctured
with law: for this will cause them to be
sufficient to themselves, and will be the means
of distributing to each of them that which is
due to him according to his desert. For thus,
also, the sun, moving in a circle through the
zodiac, distributes to every thing on the earth
generation, nutriment, and an appropriate portion
of life; administering, as if it were equitable
legislation, the excellent temperature of
the seasons. Hence, too, Jupiter is called
<em>Nomios</em>, or <em>legal</em>; and <em>Nemeios</em>, or the <em>distributor</em>.
He, likewise, who distributes nutriment
to sheep, is called <em>Nomeus</em>, or a <em>shepherd</em>; and
the songs of harpers are denominated <em>Nomai</em>.
For these properly dispose the parts of the
soul by harmony, rhythms, and measures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>


<h3 id="h6">ON THE MUTATIONS OF POLITIES, FROM THE
TREATISE OF HIPPODAMUS ON A POLITY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Every thing mortal, by a necessity of nature,
is conversant with mutations; some things,
indeed, receiving a revolution from a worse to
a better condition, but others from a better to
a worse. For things that are generated, are
increased; when increased, arrive at their
acme: after this become old, and at length
finally perish. And things, indeed, which are
generated by nature, through the same nature
terminate in the immanifest; and again from
the immanifest accede to mortality, through a
permutation of generation; and, by a reciprocation
of corruption, form a circular retrogression.
And some things, through human folly,
from an ebullition of insolence and satiety,
when both houses and cities have been exalted
to the summit of human felicity, and been
exuberantly rich, have perished, together with
their much applauded possessions. Thus,
also, it happens that every empire is bounded
by three times: by one, indeed, and that the
first, which comprehends in itself acquisition;
by the second, which comprehends fruition;
and by the last, which brings with it destruction.
For empires at their commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
being destitute of the goods of fortune, are
busied in acquisition; but afterwards becoming
prosperous, they perish. Such things, therefore,
as are under the dominion of the gods,
being incorruptible, are preserved through the
whole of time by incorruptible natures; but
such things as are under the government of
men, being mortal, receive from mortals a perpetually
various mutation. For the end, indeed,
of satiety and lascivious insolence is
destruction; but a strenuous and worthy life
is the end of poverty and narrow circumstances.
Not only poverty, however, but many
other things bring human life to an end.</p>


<h3 id="h7">FROM DIOTOGENES IN HIS TREATISE CONCERNING
A KINGDOM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">A king should be one who is most just; and
he will be most just who pays the greatest
attention to the laws. For without justice no
one will be a king; and without law there can
be no justice. For that which is just is just
through law, which is the effective cause of
justice. But a king is either animated law, or
a legal ruler. And hence it follows that he
will be most just and most observant of the
laws. There are, however, three peculiar employments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
of a king; viz. to lead an army, to
administer justice, and to worship the gods.
He will, therefore, be able to lead an army
properly, if he knows how to carry on war in
a becoming manner. But he will be skilled in
administering justice, and in governing all his
subjects, if he has well learned the nature of
justice and law. And he will worship the
gods in a pious and holy manner, if he has
diligently considered the nature and virtue of
God; so that a good king must necessarily be
a good general, judge, and priest. For these
are things consequent and suitable to the
transcendency and virtue of a king. For it is
the province of the pilot to preserve the ship,
of the charioteer to preserve the chariot, and
of the physician to save the sick; but it
belongs to a king and to a general to save
those who are in danger in battle. For of that
of which any one is the leader, he is also the
provident inspector and artificer. But to be
conversant with judicial affairs is, indeed, a
universal thing; but is particularly the proper
work of a king; who, like a god, is a leader
and protector in the world. And universally,
indeed, it is fit that the whole polity should be
coadapted to one ruler and empire; but, especially,
that things which have the relation of
parts should accord with the same harmony<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and supreme domination. Farther still, it is
the province of a king to oblige and benefit his
subjects, but this not without, justice and law.
And the third thing which is adapted to the
dignity of a king is the worship of the gods.
For it is necessary that what is most excellent
should be honoured by the most excellent;
and that which is the leader and ruler, by that
which leads and rules. Of things, therefore,
which are by nature most honourable, God is
the best; but of things on the earth, and pertaining
to men, a king is the most excellent.
As God also is to the world, so is a king to the
city [which he governs]; and as a city is to the
world, so is a king to God. For a city, indeed,
being coadapted from things which are
many and different, imitates the coarrangement
and harmony of the world; but a king
who possesses an innoxious dominion, and
who is himself animated law, exhibits the form
of God among men.</p>


<h3 id="h8">AND IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SAME
TREATISE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Hence it is necessary that a king should
not be vanquished by pleasure, but that he
should vanquish it; that he should not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
similar to, but far excel the multitude; and
that he should not conceive his proper employment
to consist in the pursuit of pleasure, but
rather in the acquisition of probity. At the
same time also it is fit that he who has occasion
to rule over others should first be able to
govern his own passions.</p>

<p>But with respect to the desire of obtaining
great property, it must be observed, that a king
ought to be wealthy in order that he may
benefit his friends, relieve those that are in
want, and justly punish his enemies. For the
enjoyment of prosperity in conjunction with
virtue is most delightful. The same thing
must be said concerning the transcendency of
a king. For since he always surpasses others
in virtue, it is fit to form a judgment of his
empire with reference to virtue, and not with
reference to riches, or power, or his military
strength. For he possesses one of these [viz.
riches] in common with any casual persons;
another [viz. power] in common with irrational
animals; and the last in common with tyrants.
But virtue is alone the peculiarity of good
men. Hence, whatever king is temperate with
respect to pleasures, liberal with respect to
money, and prudent and most skilful in governing,
he will be in reality a king. The people,
however, have the same analogy with respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
to the virtues and the vices, as the parts of the
human soul. For the desire of accumulating
more than is fit subsists about the irrational
part of the soul: for desire is not rational<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>.
But ambition and ferocity subsist about the
irascible part: for this is the fervid and strenuous
part of the soul. And the love of pleasure
subsists about the epithymetic part: for
this is the effeminate and yielding part of the
soul. But injustice, which is the most perfect
vice, and is of a composite nature, subsists
about the whole soul. Hence it is necessary
that the king should coharmonize like a lyre
the city that is furnished with good laws, first
establishing in himself the most just boundary
and order of law, as knowing that the proper
arrangement of the people, over whom divinity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
has given him dominion, ought to be coadapted
to this boundary. It is also necessary that a
good king should establish becoming positions
and habits in the delivery of public orations,
conducting himself politically, seriously, and
earnestly, in order that he may neither appear
to be rough to the multitude; nor may be contemptible;
but may be agreeable and easy in
his manners. He will however obtain these
things, if in the first place he is venerable in
his aspect and his discourse, and appears to
deserve the sovereign authority which he possesses.
But, in the second place, if he proves
himself to be benign from his behaviour to
those whom he may happen to meet, from his
countenance and his beneficence. And in the
third place, if he is formidable from his hatred
of depravity, from the punishment which he
inflicts on it, from his celerity in inflicting it,
and, in short, from his skill and exercise in
the art of government. For venerable gravity,
being a thing which imitates divinity, is capable
of causing him to be admired and honoured
by the multitude. Benignity will render
him pleasing and beloved. And his being
formidable will cause him to be terrible to
and unconquered by his enemies, and magnanimous
and confident to his friends.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, that his gravity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
should have nothing in it of an abject or vulgar
nature, but that it should be admirable, and
such as becomes the dignity of empire and a
sceptre. Nor should he ever contend with
his inferiors, or his equals, but with those that
are greater than himself; and he should conceive,
conformably to the magnitude of his
empire, that those pleasures are the greatest
which are derived from beautiful and great
deeds, and not those which arise from sensual
gratifications; separating himself indeed from
human passions, and approximating to the
Gods, not through arrogance, but through magnanimity
and an invincible transcendency of
virtue. Hence he should invest himself with
such a gracefulness and majesty in his aspect
and his reasonings, in the conceptions of his
mind, in the manners of his soul, and in his
actions and the motions and gesture of his
body, that those who survey him may perceive
that he is adorned and fashioned with modesty
and temperance, and a decorous disposition.
For a good king should convert to himself the
souls of those that behold him, no less than the
sound of a flute and harmony attract the attention
of those that hear them. And thus much
concerning the venerable gravity of a king.</p>

<p>But I shall now endeavour to speak of his
benignity. Universally, therefore, every king<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
will be benign, if he is just, equitable, and
beneficent. For justice is a connective and
collective communion, and is alone that disposition
of the soul which adapts itself to those
that are near to us. For as rhythm is to motion, and
harmony to the voice, so is justice to
communion; since it is the common good of
those that govern, and those that are governed,
because it coharmonizes political society. But
equity and benignity are certain assessors of
justice; the former indeed softening the severity
of punishment; but the latter extending
pardon to less guilty offenders. It is necessary,
however, that a good king should give
assistance to those that are in want of it, and
be beneficent. But his assistance should be
given not in one way only, but in every possible
way. And it is requisite to be beneficent, not
looking to the magnitude of honour, but to the
manner and deliberate choice of him by whom
honour is conferred. It is likewise necessary
that a worthy king should so conduct himself
towards all men as to avoid being troublesome
to them, but especially towards men of an inferior
rank and of a slender fortune: for these,
like diseased bodies, can endure nothing of a
troublesome nature. Good kings, indeed, have
dispositions similar to those of the Gods, and
which especially resemble those of Jupiter, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
ruler of all things. For he is venerable and
honourable, through transcendency and magnitude
of virtue. He is benign, because he is
beneficent, and the giver of good; and hence he
is said by the Ionic poet [Homer] to be the
father of men and Gods. He is also terrible
and transcendent, because he punishes the
unjust, and reigns and rules over all things.
But he carries thunder in his hand, as a symbol
of his formidable excellence. From all these
particulars, therefore, it is requisite to remember
that a kingdom is a God-resembling thing.</p>


<h3 id="h9">FROM THE TREATISE OF STHENIDAS THE
LOCRIAN, ON A KINGDOM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is requisite that a king should be a wise
man: for thus he will be honoured analogously
to the first God, of whom also he will
be an imitator. For this god is by nature the
first king and potentate; but a king is so by
birth and imitation. And the former rules in
the universe, and in the whole of things; but
the latter in the earth. The former also
governs all things eternally, and has a never-failing
life, possessing wisdom in himself; but
the latter acquires science through time. But
a king will imitate the first God in the most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
excellent manner, if he acquires magnanimity,
gravity, and the want of but few things; exhibiting
to his subjects a paternal disposition.
For on this account especially, the first God is
conceived to be the father both of Gods and
men, because he is mild to every thing which
is in subjection to him, and never ceases to
govern with providential regard. Nor is he
alone satisfied with being the maker of all
things, but he is the nourisher, the preceptor
of every thing beautiful, and the legislator to
all things equally. Such also ought the king
to be who rules over men on the earth. Nothing
however is beautiful which is deprived of a
king and a ruler. But it is not possible for a
king or a ruler [properly so called] to exist
without wisdom and science. He, therefore,
who is a wise man and a king, will be an imitator,
and a legitimate minister of God.</p>


<h3 id="h10">FROM THE TREATISE OF ECPHANTUS, THE
CROTONIAN, ON A KINGDOM.</h3>

<p class="noindent">That the nature of every animal is adapted
to the world, and to the things contained in the
world, appears to me to be evident from many
arguments. For every animal thus conspiring
[into union and consent], and having such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
colligation of its parts, it follows a series which
is most excellent, and at the same time necessary,
through the attractive flux of the universe
about it, which is effective of the general
ornament of the world, and the peculiar permanency
of every thing which it contains.
Hence it is called <span lang="grc">κοσμος</span> <em>kosmos</em>, and is the
most perfect of all animals. But in its parts,
which are many, and naturally different, a
certain animal excels; both from its native
alliance to the world<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, and from participating
of divinity in a greater degree. [And in the
nature, indeed, of the God who is eternal, the
stars called planets are comprehended, forming
the first and the greatest series<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>]. But in
the sublunary region, where bodies move in a
right line, the nature of demons has its subsistence.
And in the earth, and with us, the
most excellent nature is man; but the most
divine is a king, who surpasses other men in
the common nature: in his tabernacle, indeed,
[i.e. in his body], resembling other men, as
being generated from the same matter, but
fashioned from the best of artificers, who fabricated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
him, by using himself as the archetype.
Hence, in a certain respect, a king is
one and alone; being the production of the
supernal king, with whom he is always familiar:
but being beheld by his subjects in his
kingdom as in a splendid light. For a kingdom
is judged and proved to resemble the
eagle, the most excellent of winged animals,
which looks undazzled at the sun. And a
kingdom is, indeed, analogous to the sun,
because it is divine; and through excess of
splendour cannot be seen without difficulty,
except by genuine eyes. For the numerous
splendours which surround it, and the dark
vertigos which it produces in those who survey
it, as if they had ascended into a foreign
altitude, evinces that their eyes are spurious.
But those who can fitly arrive thither, on account
of their familiarity with, and alliance to
it, are able to use it properly. A kingdom,
therefore, is a thing pure, genuine, uncorrupted,
and through transcendency, most divine;
and difficult to be acceded to by man.
Hence it is necessary that he who is established
in it should be naturally most pure and pellucid
[in his soul], in order that he may not
obscure by his stains that which is most splendid;
as some persons defile the most sacred
places, and the impure pollute those they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
may happen to meet. But it is requisite that
a king, who associates with men, should participate
of an undefiled nature, and should
know how much more divine both himself and
his qualifications are than other things; and
from the exemplars to which he assimilates
himself, he should use both himself and his
subjects in the best manner. And to other
men, indeed, if they are delinquents, the most
holy purification is for them to be assimilated
to their rulers, whether law or a king administers
their affairs. But kings who cannot find
any thing on the earth to imitate more excellent
than their own nature, ought not to
wander any farther in search of a paradigm,
but should immediately become benefited by
imitating God. For neither should any one
search for the world, since he exists in, and is
a part of it; nor should he who governs others
be ignorant of him by whom he is governed.
This, however, is a most abundant ornament,
that nothing [in the universe] can be found
without a ruler.</p>

<p>The manners of a king also ought to be the
preceptors of his government. For thus the
beauty of it will immediately shine forth, since
he who imitates God through virtue will be
dear to him whom he imitates; and much
more will he be dear to his subjects. For no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
one who is beloved by divinity will be hated
by men; since neither do the stars, nor the
whole world hate God. For if they hated
their ruler and leader, they would never be
obedient to him. But because he governs
properly, mundane affairs are well governed.
I therefore, indeed, apprehend that the terrene
king ought not to be deficient in any one of the
virtues which pertain to the celestial king.
But as the former is a certain foreign and external
thing, in consequence of proceeding to
men from the heavens; so, likewise, his virtues
may be conceived to be the works of God, and
to accede to him through divinity. And if
you consider the thing from the beginning, you
will find what I say to be true. For the terrestrial
king obtains possession of the race of
men by a communion, which is the first and
the most necessary of all things. And this
race is also the possession of him who governs
every thing in the universe. For it is impossible
that any thing can subsist without friendship
and communion; the truth of which may
be easily seen, if the accustomed communion
which exists among citizens is supposed to be
destroyed; since this is much inferior to a
divine and royal nature. For natures of this
kind are not oppressed by any such indigence;
but, conformably to intellect, they supply the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
wants of others, and afford them assistance in
common. For they are perfect in virtue. But
the friendship which is in a city, and which
possesses a certain common end, imitates the
concord of the universe. But without the
arrangement of magistrates no city can be
inhabited. In order, however, to effect this
arrangement, and to preserve the city, laws
are necessary, and a certain political domination,
and also a governor and the governed.
But, the consequence of these things is, the
general good, a certain concinnity, and the
consent of the multitude in conjunction with
concordant persuasion. He, likewise, who
governs according to virtue, is called a king,
and is so [in reality]; since he possesses the
same friendship and communion with his subjects
as divinity possesses with the world, and
the natures which it contains. All benevolence,
however, ought to be exerted; in the
first place, indeed, by the king towards his
subjects; but in the second place, by the subjects
towards the king: and this benevolence
should be such as that of a parent towards his
child, of a shepherd towards his flock, and of
law towards him who uses it.</p>

<p>For there is one virtue pertaining to the
government, and to the life of men. But no
one should through indigence solicit the assistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
of others, when he is able to supply
himself with what nature requires. For though
there is a general communion [in the city], yet
every one should so live as to be sufficient
to himself; since he who is sufficient to himself
does not appear to require the aid of any
other person in his passage through life. If,
therefore, it is necessary to lead an active life,
it is evident that a king, though he should also
assume other things, will, nevertheless, be
sufficient to himself. For he will have friends
through his own virtue; and in using these, he
will not use them by any other virtue than that
by which he regulates his own life. For it is
necessary that he should follow a virtue of
this kind, since he cannot procure any thing
which is more excellent. And God, indeed,
not having either ministers or servants<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, nor
employing any mandate, and neither crowning
nor proclaiming those that are obedient to him,
or disgracing those that are disobedient, thus
administers so great an empire. But as it
appears to me exhibiting himself to be most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
worthy of imitation, he inserts in all things a
vehement desire of participating his nature.
He is, however, good; and the communication
of goodness, and this, with the greatest facility,
is his only work. But those who imitate
him<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>, accomplish every thing in a better
manner through this imitation. And the imitation
of him is to every thing the source of
sufficiency. For there is not one virtue which
makes things to be acceptable to God, and
another which imitates him; [but both these
are effected by one and the same virtue]. And
is not our terrestrial king in a similar manner
sufficient to himself? For assimilating himself
to one, and that the most excellent nature, he
will beneficently endeavour to render all whom
he governs similar to himself. But such as
offer violence to, and compel their subjects,
entirely<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> destroy in every individual of the
community a promptitude to imitate [that which
is most excellent]. For without benevolence,
it is impossible there can be assimilation; since
benevolence especially destroys every thing of
a terrific nature. It is much to be wished,
indeed, that human nature was not in want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
of persuasion: for persuasion is the relic of
human depravity, of which this temporary
animal [man] is not destitute. Persuasion,
indeed, is a thing proximate to necessity;
since this first of itself performs those things
which fly from necessity. Such beings, however,
as spontaneously use what is beautiful
and good, are not influenced by the reverence
of persuasion; for neither are they influenced
by the fear of necessity.</p>

<p>Again, a king alone is capable of effecting
this good in human nature, that through the
imitation of what is more excellent, man may
pursue what is fit and decorous; and that
those who are corrupted as if by intoxication,
and through a bad education have fallen into
an oblivion of that which is more excellent,
may through his eloquence be corroborated,
may have their diseased minds healed, and the
oblivion which dwells in them through depravity
being expelled, may have memory for
an intimate associate, from which persuasion
is produced. For this, though it originates
from depraved seeds, yet is the source of a
certain good to the inhabitants of the terrestrial
region, in which language supplies what
is deficient (through the imbecility of our nature),
in our converse with each other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>


<h3 id="h11">AND IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SAME WORK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">He who has a sacred and divine conception of
things, will be in reality a king<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>. For being
persuaded by this, he will be the cause of all
good but of no evil. And, moreover, that he
will be just, being fitted for society, is evident
to every one. For communion or association
consists in equality, and in the distribution of
it. And justice indeed precedes, but communion
participates. For it is impossible for a
man to be unjust, and yet distribute equality;
or that he should distribute equality, and yet
not be adapted to association. But how is it
possible that he who is sufficient to himself
should not be continent? For sumptuousness
is the mother of incontinence, and incontinence
of wanton insolence, from which so many
human evils are derived. But self-sufficiency
is not vanquished by sumptuousness, nor by
any thing which proceeds from it; but being
itself a certain principle, it leads all things, but
is not led by any thing. And to govern, indeed,
is the province of God, and also of a
king (on which account, likewise, he is denominated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
sufficient to himself); but it pertains
to both, not to be governed by any one. It is,
however, evident, that these things cannot be
effected without prudence. And it is manifest
that God is the intellectual prudence of
the world. For the world is connectedly contained
by gracefulness, and a fit order of things,
which cannot take place without intellect.
Nor is it possible for a king without prudence
to possess these virtues; I mean justice, continence,
communion, and such other virtues
as are the sisters of these.</p>


<h3 id="h12">FROM ARCHYTAS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The unwritten laws of the gods were promulgated
against depraved manners, inflicting a
severe destiny and penalty on the disobedient;
and these unwritten laws are the fathers and
leaders of those that are written, and of the
dogmas established by men.</p>


<h3 id="h13">FROM THE TREATISE OF DIOTOGENES ON
SANCTITY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is proper to invoke God in the beginning
both of supper and dinner, not because he is
in want of any thing of this kind, but in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
that the soul may be adorned by the recollection
of Divinity. For since we proceed from
him, and participate of a divine nature, it is requisite
that we should honour him. And since
God also is just, it is fit that we should act
justly in all things. In the next place, there
are four causes which terminate all things, and
bring them to an end, viz. nature, law, art, and
fortune. And nature, indeed, is universally
the principle of all things. But of those things
which from manners lead to political concord,
law is the inspective guardian and fabricator.
Of things which obtain their consummation
through human prudence, art is justly said to
be the mother and leader. And of those things
which, casually and accidentally, similarly befall
the worthy and the depraved, we assert
fortune to be the cause. For fortune does not
produce any thing in measure and bound, in
an orderly and prudent manner.</p>


<h3 id="h14">THE PREFACE OF CHARONDAS, THE CATANEAN,
TO HIS TREATISE OF LAWS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is requisite that those who deliberate
about, and perform any thing, should begin
from the Gods: for it is best, as the proverb
says, for God to be the cause of all our deliberations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
and works. And, farther still, it is
requisite to abstain from base actions, and
especially on account of consulting with God.
For there is no communication between God
and him who is unjust. Every one, also,
should give assistance to himself, and should
incite himself to the undertaking and performance
of such things as are conformable to his
desert; since for a man to extend himself similarly
to small and great undertakings appears
to be too sordid and illiberal. Hence, you
should be very careful to avoid falling vehemently
into things of an extended nature, and
of great consequence. But, in every undertaking,
you should measure your own desert and
power, in order that you may obtain honour
and veneration.</p>

<p>Let no assistance be afforded to a man or
woman who has been condemned by the city,
nor let any one associate with such a person,
or if he does, let him be disgraced, as being
similar to him or her with whom he associates.
But it is proper to love men who, from the
previous decision of the city, are good, and to
associate with them; and by imitating and acquiring
in reality their virtue and probity, to be
thus initiated in the greatest and most perfect
of the mysteries. For no man is perfect without
virtue. And assistance should be given to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
an injured citizen, whether he is in his own, or
in a foreign country. But let every stranger
who was venerated in his own country, and
conformably to the proper laws of that country,
be received and dismissed auspiciously
and familiarly, calling to mind hospitable Jupiter,
as a God who is established by all nations
in common, and who is the inspective guardian
of hospitality and inhospitality.</p>

<p>Let more elderly men also preside over such
as are younger, so that the latter may be
ashamed of and deterred from vice, through
reverence and fear of the former. For in cities
in which more elderly men are shameless, the
children and grandchildren of these are also
destitute of shame. But wanton insolence and
injustice are the attendants of shamelessness
and impudence. And destruction follows
these. Let, however, no one be impudent<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>,
but let every one be modest and temperate;
because he will thus have the Gods propitious
to him, and will procure for himself salvation.
For no vicious man is dear to divinity. Let
every one likewise honour probity and truth,
and hate what is base and false. For these
are the indications of virtue and vice. Hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
it is requisite to accustom children from their
youth [to worthy manners], by punishing those
that are lovers of falsehood, but being delighted
with those that are lovers of truth, in order
that in each that which is most beautiful, and
most prolific of virtue, may be implanted.
Each of the citizens, likewise, should be more
anxious to pretend to be temperate than to
pretend to be wise: for the pretence of wisdom
is a great indication of an ignorance of probity,
and is also a sign of pusillanimity. But let the
pretence of temperance be considered as a true
claim to it. For no one should feign with his
tongue, that he performs beautiful deeds, when
at the same time he is both destitute of worthy
conduct and good intentions.</p>

<p>It is likewise requisite to preserve benevolence
towards rulers, being obedient to and
venerating them as if they were parents. For
he who does not conceive that this is proper
will suffer the punishment of bad counsel from
the dæmons who are the inspective guardians
of the seat of empire. For the rulers are the
guardians of the city, and of the safety of the
citizens.</p>

<p>But it is also necessary that governors should
preside justly over those that are governed, in
the same manner as over their own children, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
passing sentence on others, laying asleep hatred,
friendship, and anger.</p>

<p>Let those likewise be praised and celebrated
who, being themselves in affluence, have assisted
the indigent, and let them be considered
as the saviours of the children and defenders
of their country. And let the wants of those
be relieved who are poor through fortune, and
not through an indolent and intemperate life.
For fortune is common to all men, but an indolent
and intemperate life is peculiar to bad
men.</p>

<p>Let it also be considered as a worthy deed,
to point out any one who has acted unjustly,
in order that the polity may be saved, which
has many guardians of its decorous arrangement.
But let the indicator of the unjust
action be considered as a pious man, though
his information should be respecting his most
familiar acquaintance. For nothing is more
familiar and allied to a man than his country.
Let, however, the indication be made, not of
things done through involuntary ignorance, but
of such crimes as have been committed from a
previous knowledge [of their enormity.] And
if he who is detected should be hostile to him
by whom he is detected, let him be hated by
all men, in order that he may suffer the punishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
of ingratitude, through which he deprives
himself of being cured of the greatest of diseases
injustice.</p>

<p>Farther still, let a contempt of the Gods be
considered as the greatest of iniquities, and
also injuring parents voluntarily, the neglecting
rulers and laws, and voluntarily dishonouring
justice. But let him be considered as a
most just and holy citizen who honours these
things, and indicates to the citizens and rulers
those that despise them.</p>

<p>Let it be esteemed to be more venerable for
a man to die for his country than, through a
desire of life, to desert it, together with probity.
For it is better to die well than to live basely
and disgracefully.</p>

<p>It is likewise requisite to honour each of the
dead, not with tears nor with lamentations, but
with good remembrance, and with an oblation
of annual fruits. For when we grieve immoderately
for those that are dead, we are ungrateful
to the terrestrial dæmons.</p>

<p>Let no one curse him by whom he has been
injured. For praise is more divine than defamation.</p>

<p>Let him be thought to be a better citizen
who is superior to anger, than him who is an
offender through it.</p>

<p>Let not him be praised but disgraced, who,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
in the sumptuousness of his expence, surpasses
temples and palaces. For let nothing private
be more magnificent and venerable than things
of a public nature.</p>

<p>Let him who is a slave to wealth and money
be despised, as one who is pusillanimous and
illiberal, and is astonished by sumptuous possessions,
and let him be considered as one who
leads a tragical life, and whose soul is vile.
For he who is magnanimous foresees with himself
all human concerns, and is not disturbed
by any thing of this kind [whether prosperous
or adverse], when it accedes.</p>

<p>Let no one speak obscenely, in order that
he may not in his thoughts approach to base
deeds, and that he may not fill his soul with
impudence and defilement. For we call things
which are decorous and lovely, by their proper
names, and by those appellations which are
established by law. But we abstain from naming
things to which we are hostile, on account
of their baseness. Let it also be considered as
base, to speak of a base thing.</p>

<p>Let every one dearly love his lawful wife,
and beget children from her. But let no one
emit the seed of his children<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> into any other
person; nor let him illegally consume that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
which is honourable both by nature and law,
and act with wanton insolence. For nature
produced the seed, for the sake of procreating
children, and not for the sake of lust.</p>

<p>But it is requisite that a wife should be
chaste, and should not admit the impious connection
with other men, as by so doing she will
subject herself to the vengeance of the dæmons,
whose office it is to expel those to whom they
are hostile from their houses, and to produce
hatred.</p>

<p>Let not him be praised who gives a stepmother
to his children<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>, but disgraced, as being
the cause of domestic dissension.</p>

<p>And as it is proper to observe these mandates,
let him who transgresses them be obnoxious
to political execration.</p>

<p>The law also orders that these <em>proems</em> should
be known by all the citizens, and should be
read in festivals after the pæans<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> by him who
is appointed for this purpose by the master of
the feast, in order that the precepts may be
inserted in the minds of all that hear them.</p>

<h3 id="h15">THE PREFACE OF ZALEUCUS, THE LOCRIAN, TO
HIS LAWS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is requisite that all those who inhabit a
city and country should in the first place be
firmly persuaded that there are Gods, in consequence
of directing their attention to the
heavens and the world, and the orderly distribution
of the natures which they contain. For
these are not the productions either of fortune
or of men. It is also requisite to reverence
and honour these, as the causes to us of every
reasonable good. It is necessary, therefore,
that every one should so prepare his soul that
it may be free from every vice; since God is
not honoured by a bad man, nor is he to be
worshiped sumptuously, nor with tragical expence,
like some depraved man; but by virtue,
and the deliberate choice of beautiful and just
deeds. Hence it is necessary that every one
should be good to the utmost of his power,
both in his actions and his deliberate choice, if
he wishes to be dear to divinity, and should
not fear the loss of money more than the loss
of renown. And it is also requisite to call
him a better citizen who would rather sustain
a loss of property than of probity and justice.</p>

<p>Let, however, such things as the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
be denounced by us against those who are not
easily impelled to do what we have above enjoined,
but whose soul is easily excited to injustice.
All citizens of this kind, both male
and female, and also those who live in the
same house with them, should remember that
there are Gods who punish the unjust, and
should place before their eyes that time in
which to every one there will be a final liberation
from life. For all such will repent when
they are about to die, from a remembrance of
their unjust deeds, and from their being impelled
to wish that all things had been done by
them justly. Hence it is necessary that every
one, in every action, should always associate
to himself this time, as if it were present: for
thus he will especially pay attention to probity
and justice. But if an evil dæmon is present
with any one, converting him to injustice, such
a one should abide in temples, at altars, and in
sacred groves, flying from injustice as a most
impious and noxious mistress, and supplicating
the Gods to cooperate with him in turning from
it. He should also accede to those men who
are renowned for their probity, in order to
hear them discourse about a blessed life, and
the punishment of bad men, that he may be
deterred from unjust deeds; but he should
only dread avenging dæmons. Those, likewise,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
that dwell in the city, should honour all
the Gods according to the legal rites of the
country, which are to be considered as the
most beautiful of all others. All the citizens,
too, should obey the laws, reverence the rulers,
and rise to them, and comply with their mandates.
For after the Gods, dæmons, and heroes,
proximate honours are paid by men who are
intelligent, and wish to be saved, to parents,
the laws, and the rulers. Let, however, no
one make the city to be dearer to him than his
country, since he will thus excite the indignation
of the Gods of the country: for such conduct
is the beginning of treachery. And farther
still, for a man to be deprived of his own
country, and to live in a foreign land, is a thing
of a more afflictive nature, and more difficult
to be borne [than most other misfortunes]: for
nothing is more allied to us than our country.
Nor let any one think that a citizen, whom the
laws have permitted to partake of the polity,
should be considered by him as an implacable
enemy; since a man who is capable of thus
thinking can neither govern nor judge in a
proper manner, in consequence of his anger
predominating over his reason. Let no one,
likewise, speak ill either of the city in common,
or of a citizen privately. But let the guardians
of the laws keep a watchful eye over offenders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
in the first place by admonishing them; and in
the next place, if they are not restrained by
this from acting ill, let them be careful that
they are punished. And with respect to the
established laws, if some one of them should
appear not to be well ordained, let it be changed
into one that is better. But where all of them
remain, let them be [universally] obeyed; as it
is neither beautiful, nor beneficial, for the established
laws to be vanquished by men; though
it is both profitable and beautiful, to be restrained,
as if vanquished, by a more excellent
law. It is requisite, however, to punish those
who transgress these, as machinating for the
city the principle of the greatest evils anarchy.
But the magistrates should neither be arrogant,
nor judge insultingly, nor in passing sentence
be mindful either of friendship or hatred, but
of what is just. For thus they will decide
most justly, and will be worthy of the magistracy.
It is fit, therefore, that slaves should do
what is just through fear, but those that are
free, through shame, and for the sake of the
beautiful in conduct. Hence it is requisite
that the governors should be men of this kind,
in order that they may be reverenced by those
whom they govern. But if any one wishes to
change some one of the established laws, or
to introduce another law, let him, with a halter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
about his neck, speak of the subject of his
wishes to the people. And if it shall appear
from the suffrages, that the law already established
should be dissolved, or that a new law
should be introduced, let him not be punished.
But if it should be thought that the preexisting
law is better, or that the law which is intended
to be introduced is unjust, let him who wishes
to change an old, or to introduce a new law,
be executed by the halter.</p>


<h3 id="h16">FROM THE TREATISE OF CALLICRATIDAS ON
THE FELICITY OF FAMILIES.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The universe must be considered as a system
of kindred communion or association. But
every system consists of certain dissimilar contraries,
and is coarranged with reference to
one certain thing, which is the most excellent,
and also with a view to a general benefit. For
that which is denominated a choir, is a system
of musical communion, and is referred to one
certain common thing, a concert of voices.
Farther still, the system of body about a ship
consists of certain dissimilar and contrary
things, and is coarranged with reference to
one thing which is best, viz. the pilot, and also
with a view to a common benefit, a prosperous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
navigation. Thus, too, a family, being a system
of kindred communion, consists of certain
dissimilars, which are its proper parts; and is
coarranged with a view to one thing which is
best, viz. the father of the family; and is referred
to a common advantage, unanimity.
And, in short, every family, in the same manner
as a psaltery<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>, requires these three things,
apparatus, coadaptation, and a certain contrectation,
and musical use. Apparatus, indeed,
being the composition of all its parts,
from which the whole, and all the system of
kindred communion derives its completion.
But of the parts of a family there are two first
and greatest divisions; viz. man and possessions,
the latter of which is the thing governed,
and affords utility. Thus, also, the first and
greatest parts of an animal are soul and body;
and soul, indeed, is that which governs and
uses, but the body is that which is governed,
and imparts utility. And possessions, indeed,
are the adscititious instruments of human life;
but the body is the connascent and allied instrument
of the soul. Of those persons, however,
that give completion to a family, some are
consanguineous, but others have an affinity to
the family. And those that are kindred are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
generated from the same blood, or have the
same origin from those who first disseminated
the race. But those that have an affinity have
an adscititious alliance, as commencing from the
communion of wedlock. And these are either
fathers or brothers, or maternal or paternal
grandfathers, or some other of those relatives
that are produced by marriage. But if the
good arising from friendship is also to be referred
to a family (for thus it will become
greater and more magnificent, not only through
an abundance of wealth and many relations,
but also through numerous friends); in this
case it is evident, that the family will thus become
more ample, and that the social species
of friendship is to be enumerated among things
which are requisite to the completion of a
family. But of possessions some are necessary,
and others are of a liberal nature. And
the necessary, indeed, are those which are subservient
to the wants of life; and the liberal
are such as lead a man to an elegant and well
arranged mode of living, so that he may not be
in want of other things. <em>Such things, however,
as exceed what is requisite to a liberal and elegant
mode of life, are, at the beginning, the roots
to men of wanton insolence, and destruction.
For those that have great possessions are necessarily
at first inflated with pride, and when thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
inflated become arrogant; and, being arrogant,
they also become fastidious, and conceive that
their kindred, and those of the same nation and
tribe with themselves, neither resemble, nor are
equal to them. But when they are fastidious,
they also become wantonly insolent. And the
extremity and end of all wanton insolence is destruction.</em>
When, therefore, in a family and city
there is a superfluity of possessions, it is necessary
that the legislator should cut off, and, as
it were, amputate the superfluities, in the same
manner as a good husbandman lops the too
luxuriant leaves of trees. But of the kindred
and domestic part of man there is a triple species.
For there is one species which governs,
another which is governed, and another which
gives assistance to a family and relatives. And
the husband, indeed, governs, but the wife is
governed, and the offspring of both these is an
auxiliary.</p>


<h3 id="h17">AND IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SAME WORK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">With respect also to practical and rational
domination, one kind is despotic, another is of
a guardian nature, and another is political.
And the despotic, indeed, is that which governs
with a view to the advantage of the governor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
and not of the governed. For after this manner
a master rules over his slaves, and a tyrant
over his subjects. But the guardian domination
subsists for the sake of the governed, and
not for the sake of those that govern. And
with this kind of power the anointers rule over
the athletæ, physicians over the sick, and preceptors
over their pupils. For their labours
are not directed to their own advantage, but to
the benefit of those whom they govern; those
of the physician being undertaken for the sake
of the sick, the anointers for the sake of exercising
the body, and those of the erudite for
the sake of the inerudite. But the political
domination has for its end the common benefit
both of the governors and the governed. For
according to this domination, in human affairs,
both a family and a city are coharmonized; but
in things of a divine nature the world is aptly
composed. A family, however, and a city are
an imitation according to analogy of the government
of the world. For divinity is the
principle of nature, and his attention is neither
directed to his own advantage, nor to private,
but to public good. And on this account, the
world is called <span lang="grc">κοσμος</span>, from the orderly disposition
of all things which are coarranged with
reference to one thing which is most excellent,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
and this is God, who is, according to conception,
an intellectual<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> animal, incorruptible, and
the principle and cause of the orderly disposition
of wholes. Since, therefore, the husband
rules over the wife, he either rules with a despotic,
or with a guardian, or, in the last place,
with a political power. But he does not rule
over her with a despotic power: for he is diligently
attentive to her welfare. Nor is his
government of her entirely of a guardian nature:
for this is itself a part of the communion
[between man and wife]. It remains, therefore,
that he rules over her with a political
power, according to which both the governor
and the thing governed establish [as their end]
the common advantage. Hence, also, wedlock
is established with a view to the communion of
life. Those husbands, therefore, that govern
their wives despotically, are hated by them;
but those that govern them with a guardian
authority are despised by them. For they
appear to be, as it were, appendages and flatterers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
of their wives. But those that govern
them politically are both admired and beloved.
And both these will be effected, if he who
governs exercises his power so that it may be
mingled with pleasure and veneration; pleasure
indeed being produced by his fondness,
but veneration from his doing nothing of a vile
or abject nature.</p>


<h3 id="h18">AND AGAIN, IN ANOTHER PART OF THE SAME
WORK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">He who wishes to marry ought to take for a
wife one whose fortune is conformable to his
own, in order that he may not contract nuptials
either above or beneath his condition, but analogous
to the property which he possesses.
For those who marry a woman above their
condition have to contend for the mastership;
for the wife, surpassing her husband in wealth
and lineage, wishes to rule over him; but he
considers it to be unworthy of him, and preternatural
to submit to his wife. But those who
marry a woman beneath their condition subvert
the dignity and splendour of their family.
It is necessary, however, on this occasion to
imitate the musician, who, having learned the
proper tone of his voice, endeavours to bring it
to such a medium that it may be rendered sufficiently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
sharp and flat, and may be neither
broken, nor lose its intenseness. Thus, therefore,
it is necessary that wedlock should be
coadapted to the peculiar tone of the soul, so
that the husband and wife may not only accord
with each other in prosperous, but also in adverse
fortune. It is requisite, therefore, that
the husband should be the regulator, master,
and preceptor of his wife. The regulator, indeed,
in paying diligent attention to her affairs;
but the master, in governing and exercising
authority over her; and the preceptor in teaching
her such things as it is fit for her to know.
This, however, will be especially effected by
him who, directing his attention to worthy
parents, marries from their family a virgin in
the flower of her youth. For such virgins are
easily fashioned, and are docile; and are also
naturally well disposed to be instructed by,
and to fear and love their husbands.</p>


<h3 id="h19">FROM THE TREATISE OF PERICTYONE<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> ON THE
DUTIES OF A WOMAN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">It is necessary that a woman should sufficiently
possess a harmony full of prudence and temperance.
For it is requisite that her soul<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
should be vehemently inclined to the acquisition
of virtue; so that she may be just, brave,
and prudent, and may be adorned with frugality,
and hate vainglory. For, from the possession
of these virtues, she will act worthily when
she becomes a wife, towards herself, her husband,
her children, and her family. Frequently,
also, such a woman will act beautifully towards
cities, if she happens to rule over cities or nations,
as we see is [sometimes] the case in a
kingdom. If, therefore, she subdues desire
and anger, a divine harmony will be produced.
Hence she will not be pursued by illegal loves,
but she will love her husband, her children,
and all her family. For such women as are
fond of being connected with other men besides
their husbands, become hostile to the whole of
their families, both to those branches of it that
are free, and those that are slaves. They also
machinate stratagems against their husbands,
and falsely represent them as the calumniators
of all their acquaintance, in order that they
alone may appear to be exceedingly benevolent;
and they govern their families in such a
way as may be expected from those that are
lovers of indolence. For from such conduct
the destruction ensues of every thing which is
common to the husband and wife. And thus
much as to these particulars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span></p>

<p>It is also requisite to lead the body to what
is naturally moderate, with respect to nutriment,
clothes, bathing, anointing, dressing the
hair, and to whatever pertains to decoration
from gold and jewels. For whatever of a
sumptuous nature is employed by women in
eating and drinking, in garments and trinkets,
renders them disposed to be guilty of every
crime, and to be unjust both to their husband’s
bed, and to every other person. It is
requisite, therefore, that they should only satisfy
hunger and thirst, and this from things
easily procured; and that they should defend
themselves from cold by garments of the simplest
kind. But to be fed with things which
are brought from a distant country, or which
are obtained at a great price, is no small vice.
It is also great folly to search after exceedingly
elegant garments, which are variegated with
purple, or any other precious colour. For the
body wishes to be neither cold nor naked, but
to be covered for the sake of decorum, and is
not [externally] in want of any thing else. The
opinion of men, however, in conjunction with
ignorance, proceeds to inanities and superfluities.
Hence a woman should neither be decorated
with gold, nor with Indian gems, nor
with the jewels of any other nation, nor plait
her hair with abundance of art, nor be perfumed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
with Arabian unguents, nor paint her face so
that it may be more white or more red, nor
give a dark tinge to her eyebrows and her eyes,
nor artificially dye her gray hairs, nor frequently
bathe. For the woman who seeks
after things of this kind searches for a spectator
of female intemperance. For the beauty
which is produced by prudence, and not by
these particulars, pleases women that are well
born. Nor should she conceive that nobility
and wealth, the being born in a great city,
glory, and the friendship of renowned and royal
men, are to be ranked among things that are
necessary. For if they happen to be present,
they should not be the cause to her of any molestation;
and if they should not be present,
she should not regret their absence. For a
prudent woman will not be prevented from
living [properly] without these. And if those
great and much admired things which we have
mentioned should not be present, her soul
should not anxiously explore, but withdraw
itself from them. For in consequence of
drawing their possessor to misfortune, they are
more noxious than beneficial. For to these,
treachery, envy, and calumny are adjacent, so
that such a woman cannot be free from perturbation.</p>

<p>It is also necessary that she should venerate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the Gods through good hope of obtaining felicity
by this veneration, and by obeying the
laws and sacred institutions of her country.
But after the Gods, I say, that she should honour
and venerate her parents. For these
cooperate with the Gods in benefiting their
children. Moreover, she ought to live with
her husband legally and kindly, conceiving
nothing to be her own property, but preserving
and being the guardian of his bed. For in the
preservation of this all things are contained.
It is likewise requisite that she should bear
every thing [in a becoming manner] which may
happen to her husband, whether he is unfortunate
in his affairs, or acts erroneously through
ignorance, or disease, or intoxication, or from
having connection with other women. For
this last error is granted to men; but not to
women, since they are punished for this offence.
It is necessary, therefore, that she should submit
to the law with equanimity, and not be
jealous. She ought likewise to bear patiently
his anger, his parsimony, and the complaints
which he may make of his destiny, his jealousy,
and his accusation of her, and whatever
other faults he may inherit from nature. For
all these she should cheerfully endure, conducting
herself towards him with prudence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and modesty. For a wife who is dear to her
husband, and who truly performs her duty towards
him, is a [domestic] harmony, and loves
the whole of her family, to which also she conciliates
the benevolence of strangers. If, however,
she neither loves her husband nor her
children, nor her servants, nor wishes to see
any sacrifice preserved; then she becomes the
leader of every kind of destruction, which she
likewise prays for, as being an enemy, and also
prays for the death of her husband, as being
hostile to him, in order that she may be connected
with other men; and, in the last place,
she hates whatever her husband loves. But it
appears to me that a wife will be a [domestic]
harmony, if she is full of prudence and modesty.
For then she will not only love her husband,
but also her children, her kindred, her
servants, and the whole of her family, in which
possessions, friends, citizens, and strangers are
contained. She will likewise adorn the bodies
of these without any superfluous ornaments,
and will both speak and hear such things only
as are beautiful and good. It is also requisite
that she should act conformably to her husband’s
opinion in what pertains to their common
life, and be satisfied with those relatives
and friends that meet with his approbation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
And she will conceive these things to be pleasant
and disagreeable which are thought to be
so by her husband, unless she is entirely destitute
of harmony.</p>


<h3 id="h20">FROM THE TREATISE OF PERICTYONE ON THE
HARMONY OF A WOMAN<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Parents ought not to be injured either in
word or deed; but it is requisite to be obedient
to them, whether their rank in life is small
or great. And in every allotted condition of
soul and body, and of external circumstances,
in peace, also, and war, in health [and sickness<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>],
in riches and in poverty, in renown and
ignominy, and whether they are of the same
class with most of the community, or are magistrates,
it is necessary to be present with,
and never to forsake them, and almost to submit
to them even when they are insane. For
such conduct will be wisely and cheerfully
adopted by those that are pious. But he who
despises his parents will, both among the living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
and the dead, be condemned for this crime by
the Gods, will be hated by men, and under the
earth will, together with the impious, be eternally<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
punished in the same place by Justice,
and the subterranean Gods, whose province it
is to inspect things of this kind. For the
aspect of parents is a thing divine and beautiful,
and a diligent observance of them is attended
with a delight such as neither the survey of the
sun, nor of all the stars which dance round the
illuminated heavens, is capable of producing,
nor any other spectacle, should it even be greater
than this. And, it appears to me, that the
Gods are not envious<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> when they perceive
that this takes place. Hence it is requisite to
reverence parents both while they are living,
and when they are dead, and never oppose
them in any thing they may say or do. If also
they are ignorant of any thing through deception
or disease, their children should console<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
and instruct, but by no means hate them on
this account. For no greater error and injustice
can be committed by men than to act impiously
towards their parents.</p>


<h3 id="h21">ON THE REVERENCE DUE TO PARENTS. FROM
THE APOPHTHEGMS OF ARISTOXENUS, THE
TARENTINE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">After divinity and demons, the greatest attention
should be paid to parents and the laws;
not fictitiously, but in reality preparing ourselves
to an observance of, and perseverance
in, the manners and laws of our country,
though they should be in a small degree worse
than those of other countries.</p>


<h3 id="h22">AND IN THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE SAME
WORK<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>.</h3>

<p class="noindent">But after these things follow the honours
which should be paid to living parents, it being
right to discharge the first, the greatest, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
the most ancient of all debts. Every one,
likewise, should think that all which he possesses
belongs to those who begot and nurtured
him, in order that he may be ministrant
to their want to the utmost of his ability,
beginning from his property; in the second
place discharging his debt to them from things
pertaining to his body; and in the third place,
from things pertaining to his soul; thus repaying
with usury the cares and pains which his
now very aged parents bestowed on him when
he was young. Through the whole of life,
likewise, it is requisite that he should particularly
employ the most respectful language
in speaking to his parents; because there is a
most severe punishment for light and winged
words; and Nemesis, the messenger of Justice,
is appointed to be the inspector of every thing
of this kind. When parents, therefore, are
angry, it is requisite to yield to them, and to
appease their anger, whether it is shown in
words or in deeds; acknowledging that a
father may reasonably be very much enraged
with his son, when he thinks he has been
injured by him. But on the death of parents,
the most decent and beautiful monuments
should be raised to them; not exceeding the
usual magnitude, nor yet less than those which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
our ancestors erected for their parents. Every
year, too, attention ought to be paid to the
decoration of their tombs. They should, likewise,
be continually remembered and reverenced,
and this with a moderate and appropriate
expense. By always acting, therefore,
and living in this manner, we shall each of us
be rewarded according to our deserts, both by
the Gods and those natures that are superior
to us, and shall pass the greatest part of our
life in good hope.</p>


<h3 id="h23">FROM THE TREATISE OF PEMPELUS
ON PARENTS<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Neither divinity, nor any man who possesses
the least wisdom, will ever advise any one to
neglect his parents. Hence we cannot have
any statue or temple which will be considered
by divinity as more precious than our fathers
and grandfathers when grown feeble with age.
For God will recompense him with benefits
who honours his parents with gifts; since if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
this is not done, divinity will not pay any attention
to the prayers of such parents for their
children. The images of our parents, indeed,
and progenitors should be esteemed by us as
far more venerable and divine than any inanimate
images. For these animated images,
when they are continually adorned and rendered
splendid with honour by us, pray for us,
and implore the gods to bestow on us the
most excellent gifts: but the contrary when
we despise them. Neither of these, however,
is effected by inanimate images. Hence he
who conducts himself in a becoming manner
towards his parents and progenitors, and
other relatives of this kind, will possess the
most proper of all statues, and the best calculated
to render him dear to divinity. Every
one, therefore, endued with intellect should
honour and venerate his parents, and should
dread their execrations and [unfavourable]
prayers, as knowing that many of them frequently
take effect. These things, therefore,
being thus disposed by nature, men that are
prudent and modest will consider their living
aged progenitors as a treasure, to the extremity
of life; and if they die before they arrive at
that period, they will be vehemently desired
by them. On the contrary, progenitors will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
terrible in the extreme to their depraved and
stupid offspring. But he who, being profane,
is deaf to these assertions, will be considered
by all intelligent persons as odious both to
Gods and men.</p>


<h3 id="h24">FROM THE TREATISE OF PHINTYS, THE DAUGHTER
OF CALLICRATES, ON THE TEMPERANCE
OF A WOMAN.</h3>

<p class="noindent">A woman ought to be wholly good and modest;
but she will never be a character of this kind
without virtue. For any virtue subsisting in
any one thing renders that which receives it
valuable. And the virtue, indeed, of the eyes
is sight, but of the ears hearing. Thus, too,
the virtue of a horse causes it to a good
horse; and the virtue of a man and the virtue
of a woman render each of them worthy. But
the principal virtue of a woman is temperance;
for through this she will be able to honour and
love her husband. Many, indeed, may perhaps
think it does not become a woman to philosophize,
as neither is it proper for her to ride
on horseback, nor to harangue in public. But
I think that some things are the province of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
man, others of a woman, and that others are
common both to man and woman. And, likewise,
that some things pertain more to a man
than to a woman; but others more to a woman
than to a man. But the things peculiar to a
man are, to lead an army, to govern, and to
harangue in public. The offices peculiar to a
woman are, to be the guardian of a house, to
stay at home, and to receive and be ministrant
to her husband. And the virtues pertaining to
both are fortitude, justice, and prudence. For
it is fit that both the husband and wife should
have the virtues of the body, and in a similar
manner those of the soul. And as health of
body is beneficial to both, so also is health of
soul. The virtues, however, of the body are
health, strength, vigour of sensation, and
beauty. With respect to the virtues, also,
some are more adapted to be exercised and
possessed by a man, but others by a woman.
For fortitude and prudence pertain more to
the man than to the woman, both on account
of the habit of the body, and the power of the
soul; but temperance peculiarly belongs to the
woman. Hence it is requisite to know the
number and the quality of the things through
which this virtue accedes to a woman. I say,
therefore, that they are these five. And in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
first place, she obtains this virtue through
sanctity and piety about the marriage bed.
In the second place, through ornament pertaining
to the body. In the third place, through
egressions from her own house. In the fourth
place, through refraining from the celebration
of orgies, and the mysteries of the mother of
the Gods<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. And in the fifth place, through
being cautious and moderate in the sacrifices
to divinity. Of these, however, the greatest
and most comprehensive cause of temperance,
is that which causes the wife to be undefiled
with respect to the marriage bed, and not to
have connexion with any other man than her
husband. For in the first place, by such illegal
conduct, she acts unjustly towards the
Gods who preside over nativities, rendering
them not genuine but spurious adjutors of her
family and kindred. In the second place, she
acts unjustly towards the Gods who preside
over nature, by whom she solemnly swore, in
conjunction with her parents and kindred, that
she would legally associate with her husband
in the communion of life and the procreation
of children. And in the third place, she acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
unjustly towards her country, by not observing
its decrees. To which may be added, that to
offend against right in those things for which
the greatest punishment, death, is ordained,
on account of the magnitude of the crime, and
to do so for the sake of pleasure and wanton
insolence, is nefarious, and most undeserving
of pardon. But the end of all insolent conduct
is destruction.</p>

<p>This, also, ought to be considered, that no
purifying remedy has been discovered for this
offence, so as to render a woman thus guilty
pure and beloved by divinity. For God is
most averse to pardon this crime. But the
best indication of the chastity of a woman
towards her husband is that which arises from
the resemblance of her children to their father.
And thus much concerning the marriage bed.</p>

<p>With respect, however, to the ornament of
the body, it appears to me, that the garments
of a woman should be white and simple, and
by no means superfluous. But they will be
so, if they are neither transparent nor variegated,
nor woven from silk, but are not
expensive, and are of a white colour. For thus
she will avoid excessive ornament, luxury, and
superfluous clothes; and will not produce a
depraved imitation in others. And, in short,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
she should not decorate her person with gold
and emeralds. For they are very expensive,
and exhibit pride and arrogance towards the
vulgar. It is necessary, however, that a city
which is governed by good laws, and is well
arranged in all its parts, should accord with
itself, and have an equable legislation; and
should expel the artificers who make things of
this kind from the city. She should, likewise,
give a splendour to her face, not by employing
adscititious and foreign colour, but that
which is adapted to the body, and is produced
by washing it with water; and adorning her
person through modesty rather than through
art. For thus she will render both herself and
her husband honourable. But the lower class
of women should go out of their houses, for
the purpose of sacrificing to the tutelar deity
of the city, for the welfare of their husbands
and all their family. A woman, also, should
depart from her house neither by twilight nor
in the evening, but should openly leave it when
the forum is full of people; accompanied by
one, or at most two servants, for the sake of
beholding a certain thing, or of buying something
she may want. She should also offer
frugal sacrifices to the Gods, and such as are
adapted to her ability; but she should abstain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
from the celebration of orgies, and from those
sacred rites of the mother of the Gods, which
are performed at home. For the common law
of the city ordains that these shall not be performed
by women. To which may be added,
that these rites introduce ebriety, and mental
alienation. It is necessary, however, that she
who is the mistress of a family, and presides
over domestic affairs, should be temperate and
undefiled.</p>

<h3 id="h25">HOW WE OUGHT TO CONDUCT OURSELVES
TOWARDS THE GODS.</h3>


<p class="noindent">Such particulars, also, as the following, are to
be previously assumed concerning the Gods,
viz. that they are immutable, and firm in their
decrees; so that they never change the conception
of what appeared to them to be fit from the
beginning. For there is one immutability and
firmness of the virtues, which it is reasonable to
suppose subsists transcendently with the Gods,
and which imparts a never-failing stability to
their conceptions. From which it is evident,
that there is no probability that the punishments
which divinity thinks proper to inflict can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
be remitted. For it is easy to infer, that if
the Gods change their decisions, and omit to
punish him whom they had designed to punish,
the world can neither be beautifully nor justly
governed; nor can any probable reason for
[the necessity of] repentance be assigned.
Poetry also appears to have asserted such
things as the following,—rashly, and without
any reason:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">By incense and libation, gentle vows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">And sacrifice and prayer, men bend the Gods,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">When they transgress, and stray from what is right<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">For flexible are e’en the Gods themselves<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in short whatever of a similar nature is
to be found in poetry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span></p>

<p>Nor must we omit to observe, that though
the Gods are not the causes of evil, yet they
connect certain persons with things of this
kind, and surround those who deserve [to be
afflicted] with corporeal and external detriments;
not through any malignity, or because
they think it requisite that men should struggle
with difficulties, but for the sake of punishment.
For as pestilence and drought, and
besides these excessive rain, earthquakes, and
every thing of this kind, are for the most part
produced through certain other more physical
causes, yet sometimes are effected by the
Gods, when the times are such that the iniquity
of the multitude, publicly, and in common,
requires to be punished; after the same
manner, also, the Gods sometimes afflict an
individual with corporeal and external detriments,
in order to punish him, and convert
others to what is right.</p>

<p>But to be persuaded that the Gods are never
the cause of any evil<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, contributes greatly, as
it appears to me, to proper conduct towards
the Gods. For evils proceed from vice alone,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
but the Gods are of themselves the causes of
good, and of whatever is advantageous; while,
in the meantime, we do not admit their beneficence,
but surround ourselves with voluntary
evils. Hence, on this occasion, it appears to
me that it is well said by the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">——that mortals blame the Gods,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">as if they were the causes of their evils!</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent4">——though not from Fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But for their crimes they suffer pain and woe<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For that God is never in any way the cause of
evil may be proved by many arguments; but at
present we shall only adduce what Plato<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> says:
viz. “that as it is not the province of what is
hot to refrigerate, but the contrary; so neither
is it the province of that which is beneficent to
be noxious, but the contrary.” Moreover, God
being good, and immediately replete from the
beginning with every virtue, cannot be noxious,
or the cause to any one of evil; but on the
contrary, must impart every good to those who
are willing to receive it; bestowing on us, also,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
such media<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> as are according to nature, and
which are effective of what is conformable
to nature. But there is only one cause of
evil<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>.</p>


<h3 id="h26">HOW WE OUGHT TO CONDUCT OURSELVES
TOWARDS OUR COUNTRY.</h3>

<p class="noindent">After speaking of the Gods, it is most reasonable
to show, in the next place, how we
should conduct ourselves towards our country.
For, by Jupiter, our country is as it were a
certain secondary God, and our first and
greatest parent. Hence he who gave a name
to the thing did not rashly denominate it <span lang="grc">πατρις</span>,
<em>patris</em>; this word being derived from <span lang="grc">πατηρ</span>,
<em>pater</em>, <em>a father</em>; but pronounced with a feminine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
termination, in order that it might be as
it were a mixture of <em>father and mother</em>. This
reason, also, proclaims that our country is to
be honoured equally with our two parents;
so that we ought to prefer it to either of them
taken separately, and not to honour the two
more than it; but to pay an equal portion of
respect to each. There is, likewise, another
reason, which exhorts us to honour it more
than our two parents conjointly; and not only
to honour it beyond these, but also to prefer it
to our wife, children, and friends; and, in
short, after the Gods, to all other things.</p>

<p>As, therefore, he is stupid who esteems one
finger more than the five, but he is most reasonable
who prefers the five to one; for the
former despises what is more eligible, but the
latter, in the five, preserves also the one finger:
after the same manner, he who wishes to save
himself rather than his country, in addition to
acting unlawfully, desires impossibilities. But
he who prefers his country to himself is dear
to divinity; and reasons fitly and firmly. At
the same time it has been observed, that though
some one should not be connumerated with
the system [or the cooperating combination of
the many], but should be considered apart
from it, yet it is fit that he should prefer the
safety of the system to his own preservation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
For the destruction of the city will evince
that the safety of the citizen entirely depends
on its existence, just as the abscission of the
hand is attended with the destruction of one
finger, as a part of the hand. We may, therefore,
summarily conclude, that general is not
<ins class="corr" id="tn-81" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'to be seperated'">
to be separated</ins> from private utility: but is to
be considered as one and the same with it.
For that which is advantageous to the country
is common to each of the parts of it; since
the whole without the parts is nothing<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>. And
vice versa, that which is advantageous to the
citizen extends also to the city, if it is assumed
as beneficial to the citizen. For that which
is useful to a dancer, so far as he is a dancer,
will also be advantageous to the whole choir.
Depositing, therefore, all this reasoning in the
discursive power of the soul, we shall receive
much light from it in particulars, so that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
shall never omit to perform what is due from
us to our country.</p>

<p>Hence, I say, it is necessary that every passion
and disease of the soul should be removed
from him who intends to act well by his country.
It is likewise requisite that a citizen
should observe the laws of his country as certain
secondary Gods, and should render himself
perfect conformably to their mandate.
But he who endeavours either to transgress, or
to make any innovation in the laws, should be
with all possible diligence prevented from
doing so, and in every way opposed. For a
contempt of the existing laws, and preferring
new to ancient laws, are things by no means
beneficial to a city. Hence it is requisite that
those should be restrained from giving their
votes, and from precipitate innovation, who
are pertinaciously disposed to act in this manner.
I therefore commend Zaleucus, the Locrian
legislator, who ordained, that he who
intended to introduce a new law, should do it
with a rope about his neck, in order that he
might be immediately strangled, unless he
could change the ancient constitution of the
polity, to the very great advantage of the community.
<em>But customs, which are truly those of
the country, and which, perhaps, are more ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
than the laws themselves, are to be preserved no
less than the laws. The present customs, however,
which are but of yesterday, and which have
been so very recently introduced into every city,
are not to be considered as the customs of the
country, [or as the institutes of ancestors]; and,
perhaps, neither are they at all to be regarded
as customs<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</em> In the next place, because custom
is an unwritten law, having for its inscription
a good legislator, viz. the approbation of
all those that use it; perhaps, on this account,
it is proximate to things which are naturally
just.</p>


<h3 id="h27">AFTER WHAT MANNER WE OUGHT TO CONDUCT
OURSELVES TOWARDS OUR PARENTS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">After speaking of the Gods and our country,
what person deserves to be mentioned more
than, or prior to our parents? Hence it is requisite
that we should discourse about them.
He, therefore, will not err who says, that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
are certain secondary and terrestrial Gods;
since on account of their proximity to us, they
are, if it be lawful so to speak, more to be honoured
by us than the Gods themselves<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>.
But it is necessary, previously, to assume, that
the only measure of gratitude towards them is
a perpetual and unremitting promptitude to
repay the benefits we have received from them;
since, though we should perform many things
for their sake, yet they will be far less than
what they deserve. At the same time, also,
it may be said, that these our deeds are nearly
theirs, because they produced us by whom
they are performed. As therefore, if the works
of Phidias and of other artists should themselves
produce certain other things, we should
not hesitate to say that these latter, also, were
the works of the artists; thus, likewise, it may
be justly said, that our performances are the
deeds of our parents; through whom we likewise
derived our existence. Hence, in order
that we may easily apprehend the duties which
we owe them, it will be requisite to have this
sentence perpetually at hand, that our parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
should be considered by us as the images of
the Gods; and by Jupiter, as domestic Gods,
our benefactors, kindred, creditors, lords, and
most stable friends. For they are most stable
images of the Gods, possessing a similitude to
them beyond the power of art to effect. For
they are the guardian Gods of the house, and
live with us; and besides this, they are our
greatest benefactors, imparting to us things of
the greatest consequence; and, by Jupiter, bestowing
on us not only what we possess, but
also such things as they wish to give us, and
for which they themselves pray. Farther still,
they are likewise our nearest kindred, and the
causes of our alliance with others. They are,
also, creditors of things of the most honourable
nature, and only repay themselves by taking
what we shall be benefited by returning. For
what gain can be so great to a child as piety
and gratitude to his parents? They are most
justly, too, our lords: for of what can we be
in a greater degree the possession, than of
those through whom we exist? Moreover,
they are perpetual and spontaneous friends
and auxiliaries; at all times, and in every circumstance,
affording us assistance. Since,
however, the name of parent is the most excellent
of all the before-mentioned appellations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
according to which we also denominate the
Gods themselves; something else must also
be added to this conception; viz. that children
should be persuaded that they dwell in their
father’s house, as if they were certain ministers
and priests in a temple, appointed and consecrated
for this purpose by nature herself;
who entrusted a reverential attention to their
parents to their care. Since of attentive regard,
therefore, one kind pertains to the body, but
another to the soul, we shall readily perform
what each of these requires, if we are willing
to do that which reason persuades us to do.
But reason persuades us to pay less attention
to the body than to the soul; though attention
to the former is necessary. We should, therefore,
procure for our parents liberal food, and
such as is adapted to the imbecility of old age;
and besides this, a bed, sleep, unction, a bath,
garments; and in short, all the necessaries
which the body requires, that they may never
at any time experience the want of any of these;
in thus acting, imitating their care about our
nurture, when we were infants. Hence, we
should compel ourselves to employ a certain
prophetic attention to them, in order to discover
what they particularly desire of things
pertaining to the body, though they should not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
indicate the object of their wish<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>. For they
divined many things respecting us, when we
frequently signified by inarticulate and mournful
sounds, that we were in want of certain
things, but were unable to indicate clearly the
subjects of our wants. So that our parents,
by the benefits which they formerly conferred
upon us, become the preceptors to us of what
we ought to bestow on them.</p>

<p>With respect to the souls of our parents, we
should, in the first place, procure for them
hilarity; which will be especially obtained, if
we are conversant with them by night and by
day, unless something prevents us, walking,
being anointed, and living together with them.
For as to those who are undertaking a long
journey, the converse of their families and
friends is most delightful, after the manner of
those that accompany a solemn procession;
thus, also, to parents who are now verging to
the grave, the sedulous and unremitting attention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
of their children is most acceptable, and most
dear. Moreover, if at any time they should
act wrong, which frequently happens to be the
case with many, and especially with those who
have been educated in a more vulgar manner;
they should be corrected indeed, yet not by
Jupiter with reprehension, as we are accustomed
to do to our inferiors or equals, but as
it were, with exhortation; and not as if they
had erred through ignorance, but as if they
had committed an oversight, through inattention;
and that if they had attended, they would
by no means have erred. For admonitions,
and especially if they are vehement, are grievous
to those that are old. Hence, it is necessary,
that the remedy of their oversight should be
accompanied by mild exhortation, and a certain
elegant artifice. Children, likewise, increase
the joy of their parents, by performing
for them servile offices, such as washing their
feet, making their bed, and waiting on them
after the manner of servants. For they are
not a little delighted, when they receive necessary
servile attentions from the most dear
hands of their children, and make use of their
ministrant works. But parents will be especially
gratified when their children are seen to
honour those whom they love and very much
esteem. On which account, it is fit that children<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
should affectionately love the kindred of
their parents, and pay a proper attention to
them, and in a similar manner should love the
friends of, and all those that are dear to their
parents. And this being admitted, we shall be
enabled to collect many other duties of children
to their parents, which are neither small
nor casual. For since our parents are gratified
by the attention which we pay to those
whom they love, but we are in a most eminent
degree beloved by our parents, it is evident
that we shall very much please them, by paying
a proper attention to ourselves.</p>


<h3 id="h28">ON FRATERNAL LOVE.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The first admonition, therefore, is very clear,
easily obtained, and is common to all men.
For it is a sane assertion, which every man
will consider as evident. And it is this: Act
by every one, in the same manner as if you
supposed yourself to be him, and him to be
you<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>. For he will use a servant well who considers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
with himself, how he would think it
proper to be used by him, if he indeed was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
master, and himself the servant. The same
thing also must be said of parents with respect
to children, and of children with respect to
parents; and, in short, of all men with respect
to all. This admonition, however, is transcendently
adapted to the alliance of brothers to
each other; since nothing else is necessary for
him to admit previously, who considers how
he ought to conduct himself towards his brother,
than promptly to assume the natural
sameness of the person of each of them. This,
therefore, is the first admonition, that a man
should act towards his brother in the same
way in which he would think it proper that his
brother should act towards him. But, by Jupiter,
some one may say, I do not exceed propriety
in my manners and am equitable, but
my brother’s manners are rough and without
affability. Such a one, however, does not
speak rightly. For, in the first place, perhaps
he does not speak the truth; since an excessive
love of self is sufficient [to induce a man] to
magnify and extol what pertains to himself, but
to diminish and vilify what pertains to others.
Frequently, therefore, men of inferior worth,
prefer themselves to others who are far more
excellent characters. And, in the next place,
though the brother should be in reality such a
person [as above described], I should say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
prove yourself to be a better man than he is,
and you will vanquish his rusticity by your
beneficence. For no great thanks are due to
those who conduct themselves moderately towards
worthy and benignant men; but to render
him more mild who is stupid, and whose
manners are rough, is the work of a man [properly
so called], and deserves great applause.
Nor is it at all impossible for the exhortation
to take effect. For in men of the most absurd
manners, there are the seeds of a mutation to
a better condition, and of honour and love for
their benefactors. For are not even savage
animals, and such as are naturally most hostile
to our race, and who are taken away by violence,
and at first are detained by chains, and
confined in iron cages,—are not these afterwards
rendered mild by a certain mode of
treatment, and by daily supplying them with
food? And will not the man who is a brother,
or even any casual person, who deserves attention
in a much greater degree than a brute,
be changed to milder manners by proper treatment,
though he should not entirely forsake
his rusticity? In our behaviour, therefore, towards
every man, and in a much greater degree
towards a brother, we should imitate the reply
of Socrates to one who said to him, “May I
die unless I am revenged on you.” For his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
answer was, “May I die, if I do not make you
my friend.” And thus much concerning these
particulars.</p>

<p>In the next place, a man should consider
that after a manner his brothers are parts of
him, just as my eyes are parts of me; and likewise
my legs, my hands, and the remaining
members of my body. For brothers have the
same relation to a family considered as one
thing [as the parts to the whole of the body].
As, therefore, the eyes and the hands, if each
of them should receive a peculiar soul and intellect,
would, by every possible contrivance,
pay a guardian attention to the remaining parts
of the body, on account of the before-mentioned
communion, because they could not perform
their proper office well without the presence of
the other members; thus also it is requisite
that we who are men, and who acknowledge
that we have a soul, should omit no offices
which it becomes us to perform to our brothers.
For again, brothers are more naturally
adapted to assist each other, than are the parts
of the body. For the eyes, indeed, being present
with each other, see what is before them,
and one hand cooperates with the other which
is present; but the mutual works of brothers
are, in a certain respect, much more multifarious.
For they perform things which are profitable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
in common, though they should be at
the greatest distance from each other; and they
greatly benefit each other, though the interval
which separates them should be immeasurable.
In short, it must be considered, that our life
appears to be a certain long war continued to
the extent of many years; and this partly
through the nature of the things themselves
which possess a certain opposition; and partly
through the sudden and unexpected occurrences
of fortune; but most of all through vice
itself, which neither abstains from any violence,
nor from any fraud and evil stratagems. Hence
nature, as not being ignorant of the purpose for
which she generated us, produced each of us
accompanied, after a certain manner, by an
auxiliary. No one, therefore, is alone, nor
does he derive his origin <em>from an oak or a rock</em>,
but from parents, and in conjunction with brothers,
and kindred, and other familiars. But
reason affords us great assistance, conciliating
to us strangers, and those who have no connection
with us by blood, and procuring for us
an abundance of auxiliars. On this account
we naturally endeavour to allure and make
every one our friend. Hence it is a thing perfectly
insane to wish to be united to those who
have not any thing from nature which is capable
of procuring our love, and voluntarily to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
become familiar with them in the most extended
degree; and yet neglect those prompt
auxiliars and associates which are supplied by
nature herself, such as brothers happen to be.</p>


<h3 id="h29">ON WEDLOCK.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The discussion of wedlock is a thing most necessary.
For the whole of our race is naturally
adapted to society. But the first and
most elementary of all associations is that
which is effected by marriage. For cities could
not exist without a household; but the household
of an unmarried man is truly imperfect;
while, on the contrary, of him who is married,
it is perfect and full. Hence we have shown
in our treatise On Families, that a life accompanied
by wedlock is to be precedaneously
chosen by the wise man; but a single life is
not to be chosen, except particular circumstances<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
require it. So that as it is requisite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
we should imitate the man of intellect where
we can, but marriage is with him an object of
precedaneous choice; it is evident that it will
also be proper for us, unless some circumstance
occurs to prevent it from taking place. And
this is the first reason why wedlock is most
necessary.</p>

<p>But it seems that Nature herself, prior to the
wise man, incites us to this, who also exhorts
the wise man to marry. For she not only made
us gregarious, but likewise adapted to copulation,
and proposed the procreation of children
and stability of life, as the one and common
work of wedlock. But Nature justly teaches
us, that a choice of such things as are fit should
be made so as to accord with what she has
procured for us. Every animal, therefore, lives
conformably to its natural constitution, and,
by Jupiter, in a similar manner every plant
lives agreeably to the life which is imparted to
it. Only there is this difference between the
two, that the latter do not employ any reasoning,
or a certain enumeration, in the selection
of things which they explore; as they make
use of nature alone, because they do not participate of
soul; but animals are led to investigate
what is proper for them by imaginations
and exciting desires. To us, however, Nature
gave reason, in order that it might survey every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
thing else, and, together with all things, or
rather prior to all things, might direct its attention
to Nature herself, so as in an orderly manner
to tend to her as to a very splendid and
stable mark, and choosing every thing which is
consonant to her, might cause us to live in a becoming
manner. Hence he will not err, who
says that a family is imperfect without wedlock.
For it is not possible to conceive of a
governor without the governed, nor of the governed
without a governor. And this reason
appears to me to be very well calculated to
make those ashamed who are adverse to marriage.</p>

<p>I say, therefore, that marriage is likewise
advantageous. In the first place, indeed, because
it produces a truly divine fruit, the procreation
of children, since they will be assistants
to us in all our actions (as partaking of
our nature), while our strength is yet entire;
and they will be good auxiliars, when we are
worn out, and oppressed with old age. They
will also be the familiar associates of our joy
in prosperity, and sympathizing participants of
our sorrows in adversity. Farther still, besides
the procreation of children, the association
with a wife is advantageous. For, in
the first place, when we are wearied with
labours out of the house, she receives us with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
officious kindness, and recreates us by every
possible attention. In the next place, she produces
in us an oblivion of our molestations.
For those sorrowful circumstances of life which
take place in the forum, or the gymnasium, or
the country, and, in short, all the cares and
solicitudes occasioned by converse with our
friends and familiars, do not so obviously molest
us, being obscured by our necessary occupations;
but when we are liberated from these,
return home, and our mind becomes, as it
were, at leisure, then these cares and solicitudes
approach, availing themselves of this
occasion, in order to torment us, at the time
when life is destitute of benevolence, and is
solitary. Then, however, the wife being present
becomes a great solace on this occasion,
by making some inquiries about <ins class="corr" id="tn-98" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'external af-affairs'">
external affairs</ins>, or by referring to, and considering, together
with her husband, something about domestic
concerns, and thus, by her unfeigned
alacrity, affords him a certain exuberance of
pleasure and delight. But it would be too
prolix to enumerate particularly the benefit of
a wife in festivals, for the purpose of procuring
sacrifices and victims; in the journeys of her
husband, by preserving the family in a stable
condition, and not suffering it to be entirely
without a ruler; in paying proper attention to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
the domestics; and in the aid which she affords
her husband when he is afflicted with
disease. For it is sufficient summarily to say,
that <em>two things are necessary to all men, in order
to pass through life in a becoming manner, viz.
the aid of kindred and sympathetic benevolence.
But we cannot find any thing more sympathetic
than a wife, nor any thing more kindred than
children. Both these, however, marriage affords.</em>
How is it possible, therefore, that it
should not be most advantageous to us?</p>

<p>I also think that a married life is beautiful.
For what other thing can be such an ornament
to a family, as is the association of husband
and wife? For it must not be said that sumptuous
edifices, walls covered with marble plaster,
and piazzas adorned with stones, which
are admired by those who are ignorant of true
good, nor yet paintings and arched myrtle
walks, nor any thing else which is the subject
of astonishment to the stupid<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>, is the ornament
of a family. But the beauty of a household<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
consists in the conjunction of man and wife,
who are united to each other by destiny, and
are consecrated to the Gods who preside over
nuptials, births, and houses, and who accord,
indeed, with each other, and have all things
in common, as far as to their bodies, or rather
their souls themselves; who likewise exercise
a becoming authority over their house and servants;
are properly solicitous about the education
of their children; and pay an attention
to the necessaries of life, which is neither excessive
nor negligent, but moderate and appropriate.
For what can be better and more excellent,
as the most admirable Homer says,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">Than when at home the husband and the wife</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Unanimously live<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">On which account I have frequently wondered
at those who conceive that the life with a woman
is burdensome and grievous. For a wife
is not by Jupiter either a burden or a molestation,
as to them she appears to be; but, on the
contrary, she is something light and easy to be
borne, or rather, she possesses the power of
exonerating her husband from things truly
troublesome and weighty. For there is not
any thing so troublesome which will not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
easily borne by a husband and wife when they
are concordant, and are willing to endure it in
common. But imprudence is truly burdensome,
and difficult to be borne by its possessors:
for through it things naturally light, and
among others a wife, become heavy. In reality,
indeed, marriage to many is intolerable, not
from itself, or because such an association as
this with a woman is naturally insufferable;
but when we marry those whom we ought not,
and, together with this, are ourselves entirely
ignorant of life, and unprepared to take a wife
in such a way as a free and ingenuous woman
ought to be taken, then it happens that this
association with her becomes difficult and intolerable.
It is certain, indeed, that marriage is
effected by the vulgar after this manner. For
they do not take a wife for the sake of the procreation
of children, and the association of life;
but some are induced to marry through the
magnitude of the portion, others through transcendency
of form, and others through other
such like causes; and by employing these bad
counsellors, they pay no attention to the disposition
and manners of the bride, but celebrate
nuptials to their own destruction, and
with their doors crowned introduce to themselves
a tyrant instead of a wife, whom they
cannot resist, and with whom they are unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
to contend for the chief authority. It is evident,
therefore, that marriage through these
causes, and not through itself, becomes burdensome
and intolerable to many. It is proper,
however, as it is said, neither to blame
things which are innoxious, nor to make our
imbecility in the use of things the cause of
complaint against them. Besides, it is also in
other respects most absurd, to investigate on
all sides the auxiliaries of friendship, and procure
certain friends and associates, as those
who will aid and defend us in the difficulties of
life, and yet not explore and endeavour to obtain
that relief, defence, and assistance which
are afforded us by nature, by the laws, and by
the Gods, through a wife and children.</p>

<p>With respect to a numerous offspring, it is
after a certain manner, according to nature and
consentaneous to marriage, that all, or the
greatest part of those that are born, should be
nurtured. Many, however, appear to be unpersuaded
by this admonition, through a cause
not very decorous: for they are thus affected
through a love of riches, and because they
think poverty to be a transcendently great evil.
In the first place, therefore, it must be considered,
that in procreating children, we not only
beget assistants for ourselves, nourishers of our
old age, and participants with us of every fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
and every circumstance that may occur in
life;—I say, we do not beget them for ourselves
alone, but in many things also for our parents.
For the procreation of children is gratifying to
them; because, if we should suffer any thing of
a calamitous nature prior to their decease, we
shall leave our children instead of ourselves, as
the support of their old age. But it is a beautiful
thing for a grandfather to be conducted
by the hands of his grandchildren, and to be
considered by them as deserving of every other
attention. Hence, in the first place, we shall
gratify our own parents, by paying attention to
the procreation of children. And, in the next
place, we shall cooperate with the prayers and
ardent wishes of those that begot us. For they
from the first were solicitous about our birth,
conceiving that through it there would be a
very extended succession of themselves, and
that they shall leave behind them children of
children, and have to pay attention to our marriage,
our procreation, and nurture. Hence,
by marrying and begetting children, we shall
accomplish, as it were, a part of their prayers;
but, by being of a contrary opinion, we shall cut
off the object of their deliberate choice. <em>Moreover,
it appears that every one who voluntarily,
and without some prohibiting circumstance, avoids<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
marriage, and the procreation of children, accuses
his parents of madness, as not having engaged
in wedlock with right conceptions of
things.</em> It is easy also to see, that such a one
forms an incongruous opinion. For how is it
possible that he should not be full of dissension,
who finds a pleasure in living, and willingly
continues in life as one who was produced
into existence in a becoming manner by
his parents, and yet conceives that for him to
procreate others is one among the number of
things which are to be rejected? In the first
place, however, as we have before observed, it
is requisite to consider, that we do not beget
children for our own sakes alone, but for those
also through whom we ourselves were begotten;
and, in the next place, for the sake of our
friends and kindred. For it is gratifying to
these to see children which are our offspring,
both on account of benevolence and propinquity,
and on account of security. For the
life of those to whom these pertain, is established
as in a port by a thing of this kind,
analogously to ships, which, though greatly
agitated by the waves of the sea, are firmly secured
by many anchors. On this account, the
man who is a lover of his kindred, and a lover
of his associates, will earnestly desire to marry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and procreate children. We are likewise
loudly called upon by our country to do so.
For we do not beget children so much for ourselves
as for our country, procuring a race that
may follow us, and supplying the community
with our successors. Hence the priest should
know that he owes priests to his city; the
ruler that he owes rulers; the public orator
public orators; and, in short, the citizen that
he owes citizens to it. As, therefore, to a
choir the perennial continuance of those that
compose it is gratifying, and to an army the
duration of the soldiers, so to a city is the lastingness
of the citizens. If, indeed, a city was
a certain system of a short duration, and the
life of it was commensurate with the life of
man, it would not be in want of succession.
But since it is extended to many generations,
and if it employs a more fortunate dæmon endures
for many ages, it is evident that it is not
only necessary to direct our attention to the
present, but also to the future time, and not despise
our natal soil, and leave it desolate, but
establish it in good hopes from our posterity.</p>

<h3 id="h30">HOW WE OUGHT TO CONDUCT OURSELVES
TOWARDS OUR [OTHER] KINDRED.</h3>

<p class="noindent">The consideration of the duties pertaining to
[our other] kindred is consequent to the discussion
of those that pertain to parents, brothers,
wives, and children; for the same things
may, in a certain respect, be said of the former
as of the latter; and on this account may be
concisely explained. For, in short, each of us
is, as it were, circumscribed by many circles;
some of which are less, but others larger, and
some comprehend, but others are comprehended,
according to the different and unequal
habitudes with respect to each other. For the
first, indeed, and most proximate circle is that
which every one describes about his own mind
as a centre, in which circle the body, and
whatever is assumed for the sake of the body,
are comprehended. For this is nearly the
smallest circle, and almost touches the centre
itself. The second from this, and which is at
a greater distance from the centre, but comprehends
the first circle, is that in which parents,
brothers, wife, and children are arranged.
The third circle from the centre is that which
contains uncles and aunts, grandfathers and
grandmothers, and the children of brothers and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
sisters. After this is the circle which comprehends
the remaining relatives. Next to this is
that which contains the common people, then
that which comprehends those of the same
tribe, afterwards that which contains the citizens;
and then two other circles follow, one
being the circle of those that dwell in the vicinity
of the city, and the other, of those of the
same province. But the outermost and greatest
circle, and which comprehends all the other
circles, is that of the whole human race<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span></p>

<p>These things being thus considered, it is the
province of him who strives to conduct himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
properly in each of these connections to
collect, in a certain respect, the circles, as it
were, to one centre, and always to endeavour
earnestly to transfer himself from the comprehending
circles to the several particulars which
they comprehend. It pertains, therefore, to
the man who is a lover of kindred [to conduct
himself in a becoming manner<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>] towards his
parents and brothers; also, according to the
same analogy, towards the more elderly of his
relatives of both sexes, such as grandfathers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
uncles and aunts; towards those of the same
age with himself, as his cousins; and towards
his juniors, as the children of his cousins.
Hence we have summarily shown how we
ought to conduct ourselves towards our kindred,
having before taught how we should act
towards ourselves, our parents, and brothers;
and besides these, towards our wife and children.
To which it must be added, that those
who belong to the third circle must be honoured
similarly to these; and again, kindred similarly
to those that belong to the third circle.
For something of benevolence must be taken
away from those who are more distant from
us by blood; though at the same time we
should endeavour that an assimilation may
take place between us and them. For this
distance will become moderate, if, through the
diligent attention<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> which we pay to them, we
cut off the length of the habitude towards each
individual of these. We have unfolded, therefore,
that which is most comprehensive and
important in the duties pertaining to kindred.</p>

<p>It is requisite, likewise, to add a proper
measure conformably to the general use of
appellations, calling indeed cousins, uncles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and aunts, by the name of brothers, fathers
and mothers; but of other kindred, to denominate
some uncles, others the children of
brothers or sisters, and others cousins, according
to the difference of age, for the sake of the
abundant extension which there is in names.
For this mode of appellation will be no obscure
indication of our sedulous attention to
each of these relatives; and at the same time
will incite, and extend us in a greater degree,
to the contraction as it were of the above mentioned
circles. But as we have proceeded
thus far in our discussion, it will not be unseasonable
to recall to our memory the distinction
with respect to parents, which we before
made. For in that place in which we compared
mother with father, we said that it was
requisite to attribute more of love to a mother,
and more of honour to a father; and conformably
to this, we shall here add, that it is fit to
have more love for those who are connected
with us by a maternal alliance, but to pay
more honour to those who are related to us
by a paternal affinity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span></p>


<h3 id="h31">ON ECONOMICS.</h3>

<p class="noindent">Prior to all things, it is requisite to speak of
the works through which the union of a family
is preserved. These, therefore, are to be divided
after the accustomed manner; viz. rural,
forensic, and political works are to be attributed
to the husband; but to the wife, such
works as pertain to spinning wool, making of
bread, cooking, and, in short, every thing of a
domestic nature. Nevertheless, it is not fit
that the one should be entirely exempt from
the works of the other. For sometimes it will
be proper when the wife is in the country that
she should superintend the labourers, and perform
the office of the master of the house; and
that the husband should sometimes convert his
attention to domestic affairs; and partly inquire
about, and partly inspect what is doing
in the house. For thus, what pertains to the
mutual association of both will be more firmly
connected by their joint participation of necessary
cares. Since, however, our discussion
has extended thus far, it appears to me that I
ought not to omit to mention manual operations;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
for it will not be incongruous to add
this also to what has been said about works.</p>

<p>What occasion, therefore, is there to say,
that it is fit the man should meddle with agricultural
labours? For there are not many by
whom this will not be admitted. But though
so much luxury and idleness occupies the life
of men of the present day, yet it is rare to find
one who is not willing to engage in the labour
of sowing and planting; and to be employed
in other works which pertain to agriculture.
Perhaps, however, the arguments will be much
less persuasive, which call on the man to
engage in those other works which belong to
the woman. For such men as pay great attention
to neatness and cleanliness will not
conceive the spinning of wool to be their business:
since, for the most part, vile diminutive
men, and the tribe of such as are delicate and
effeminate apply themselves to the elaboration
of wool, through an emulation of feminine softness.
But it does not become a man, who is
truly so called, to apply himself to things of
this kind; so that neither shall I, perhaps, advise
those to engage in such employments, who
have not given perfectly credible indications
of their virility and modesty. What, therefore,
should hinder the man from partaking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
the works which pertain to a woman, whose
past life has been such as to free him from all
suspicion of absurd and effeminate conduct?
For in other domestic works, is it not thought
that more of them pertain to men than to
women? For they are more laborious, and
require corporeal strength, such as to grind,
to knead meal, to cut wood, to draw water
from a well, to transfer large vessels from one
place to another; to shake coverlets and carpets,
and every other work similar to these.
And it will be sufficient, indeed, for these
things to be performed by men. But it is
also fit that some addition should be made to
the legitimate work of a woman, so that she
may not only engage with her maid servants
in the spinning of wool, but may also apply
herself to other more virile works. For it appears
to me that the making of bread, the
drawing of water [from a well], the lighting of
fires, the making of beds, and every other work
similar to these are the proper employments
of a freeborn woman. But a wife will seem
much more beautiful to her husband, and especially
if she is young, and not yet worn out by
the bearing of children, if she becomes his
associate in gathering grapes, and collecting
olives; and if he is verging to old age, she will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
render herself more pleasing to him, by partaking
with him of the labour of sowing and
ploughing, and extending to him, while he is
digging or planting, the instruments proper
for such works. For when a family is governed
after this manner by the husband and
wife, so far as pertains to necessary works, it
appears to me that it will be conducted in this
respect in the best manner.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> The following extract from Bentley’s Eighth Sermon at
Boyle’s Lectures, sufficiently shows the doctor’s deficiency
in intellect. “Nor do we count it any absurdity, that such a
vast and immense universe should be made for the sole use
of such mean and unworthy creatures as the children of men.
For if we consider the dignity of an intelligent being, and
put that in the scales against brute inanimate matter, we
may affirm, without overvaluing human nature, that the soul
of one virtuous and religious man is of greater worth and
excellency than the sun and his planets, and all the stars in
the world.” For this opinion is not only stupid and arrogant
in the extreme, but is also contrary to the doctrine of
the Scriptures, of which the doctor was a teacher. For as I
have observed in p. 13 of the Introduction to my translation
of Proclus On the Theology of Plato, “the stars are
not called Gods by the Jewish legislator, as things inanimate
like statues fashioned of wood or stone.” This is evident
from what is said in the book of Job, and the Psalms.
“Behold even the moon and it shineth not, yea the stars
are not pure in his sight. How much less man that is a
worm, and the son of man which is a worm?” (Job, xxv.
v. 5 and 6). And, “When I consider thy heavens, the
work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars which thou hast
ordained; what is man that thou art mindful of him, and the
son of man that thou visitest him.” (Psalm viii. v. 3 and 4.)
It is evident, therefore, from these passages, that the heavens
and the stars are more excellent than man; but nothing
inanimate can be more excellent than that which is animated.
To which may be added, that in the following verse
David says, that God has made man a little lower than the
angels. But the stars, as I have demonstrated in the above
mentioned Introduction, were considered by Moses as angels
and Gods; and consequently they are animated beings, and
superior to man.</p>

<p>Farther still, it is said in Psalm xi. v. 4, that “the Lord’s
throne is in heaven.” And again, in Isaiah, chap. lxvi. v. 1.
“Thus saith the Lord, the heaven is my throne, and the
earth is my footstool.” If, therefore, the heavens are the
throne of Deity, they must evidently be deified. For nothing
can come into immediate contact with divinity, without
being divine. Hence, says Simplicius, (in Comment in
Lib. ii. de Cælo.) “That it is connascent with the human
soul to think the celestial bodies are divine, is especially
evident from those (the Jews), who look to these bodies
through preconceptions about divine natures. For they also
say that the heavens are the habitation of God, and the
throne of God, and are alone sufficient to reveal the glory
and excellence of God to those who are worthy; than which
assertions what can be more venerable?”</p>

<p>Indeed, that the heavens are not the inanimate throne and
residence of Deity, is also evident from the assertion in the
nineteenth Psalm, that “the heavens declare the glory of
God.” For R. Moses, a very learned Jew, (See Gaffarel’s
Unheard-of Curiosities, p. 391.) says, “that the word <em>saphar</em>
to <em>declare</em>, or <em>set forth</em>, is never attributed to things inanimate.”
Hence he concludes, “that the heavens are not
without some soul; which, says he, is no other than that of
those blessed intelligences who govern the stars, and dispose
them into such letters as God has ordained; <em>declaring</em> unto
us men, by means of this writing, what events we are to
expect. And hence this same writing is called by all the
ancients, <em>chetab hamelachim</em>; that is to say, <em>the writing of
the angels</em>.”</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">[6]</a> For so the Christians were called by the heathens,
when the religion of the latter was rapidly declining, and
that of the former had gained the ascendency. Thus Porphyry,
in a passage preserved by Theodoret, (in lib. i. De
Curat. Græc. Superst.) <span lang="grc">Χαλκοδετος γαρ η προς θεους οδος,
αιπεινη τε και τραχεια, ης πολλας ατραπους Βαρβαροι μεν
εξευρον, Ελληνες δε επλανηθησαν, οι δε κρατουντες ηδη και
διεφθειραν.</span> i.e. “For the way which leads to the Gods is
bound with chains of brass, and is arduous and rough, many
paths of which were indeed discovered by the Barbarians;
but the Greeks have wandered from them, and they are
entirely corrupted by <em>those who now prevail</em>.”</p>

<p>This passage of Porphyry, derived its origin from the
following oracle of Apollo, preserved by Eusebius:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry" lang="grc">
    <div class="verse indent0">Αιπεινη γαρ οδος μακαρων τρηχεια τε πολλον,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Χαλκοδετοις τα πρωτα διοιγομενη πυλεωσιν.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ατραπετοι δε εασσιν αθεσφατοι εγγεγαυιαι,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ας πρωτοι μεροπων επ’ απειρονα πρηξιν εφηναν</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ασσυριοι Λυδοι τε, και Εβραιων γενος ανδρων.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But for <span lang="grc">Εβραιων</span>, in the last line, I read <span lang="grc">Χαλδαιων</span>, it not
being at all reasonable to suppose that an oracle of Apollo
would say that the Hebrews knew many paths which led to
the knowledge of the Gods. It is probable, therefore, that
either Aristobulus the Jew, well known for interpolating the
writings of the heathens, or the wicked Eusebius, as he is
called by the Emperor Julian, has fraudulently substituted
the former word for the latter. The Oracle, with this emendation,
will be in English as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0">The path by which to deity we climb</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is arduous, rough, ineffable, sublime;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the strong massy gates, through which we pass</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In our first course, are bound with chains of brass.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Those men the first who of Egyptian birth</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Drank the fair water of Nilotic earth,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Disclosed by actions infinite this road,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">This road the Assyrians pointed out to view,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And this the Lydians and Chaldeans knew.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But when Porphyry says that the Greeks have wandered
from the path which leads to divinity, he alludes to their
worshipping men as Gods; which, as I have shown in the
Introduction to my translation of Proclus On the Theology
of Plato, is contrary to the genuine doctrine of the heathen
religion; and was the cause of its corruption, and final
extinction, among the Greeks and Romans.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="label">[9]</a> An adept in the philosophy of Plato will at once be
convinced of the truth of this assertion, by comparing what
Hierocles has said about prayer in his Commentary On the
Golden Verses of the Pythagoreans, with what is said respecting
it by Iamblichus, in his Treatise on the Mysteries;
and by Proclus, at the beginning of the second book of his
Commentary On the Timæus of Plato. See the Introduction
to the second Alcibiades, in Vol. 4. of my translation of
Plato, and the Notes to my translation of Maximus Tyrius;
in which the reader will find what Iamblichus, Proclus, and
Hierocles have said on this subject. And that he was not
consummately accurate in his knowledge, will be evident by
comparing what he says in his above mentioned Commentary,
about that middle order of beings denominated <em>the
illustrious heroes</em>, with what Iamblichus and Proclus have
most admirably unfolded concerning them. And this will
still more plainly appear from what he says about the celebrated
<em>tetrad</em>, or <em>tetractys</em> of the Pythagoreans, in p. 166,
and 170, of the same Commentary. For in both these
places, he clearly asserts, that this tetrad is the same with
the <em>Demiurgus</em>, or <em>maker</em> of <em>the universe</em>. Thus, in the
former of these places <span lang="grc">και την τετραδα πηγην της αιδιου
διακοσμησεως, αποφαινεται την αυτην ουσαν τῳ δημιουργῳ
θεῳ.</span> i.e. “And the author of these verses shows that the
tetrad, which is the fountain of the perpetual orderly distribution
of things, is the same with the God who is the Demiurgus.”
And in the latter passage, <span lang="grc">εστι γαρ ως εφαμεν, δημιουργος
των ολων και αιτια η τετρας, θεος νοητος, αιτιος του
ουρανιου και αισθητου θεου.</span> i.e. “For as we have said, the
tetrad is the Demiurgus and cause of the wholes of the universe,
being an intelligible God, the source of the celestial
and sensible God.” The tetrad, however, or the <em>animal
itself</em>, (<span lang="grc">το αυτωζωον</span>) of Plato; who, as Syrianus justly observes,
was the best of the Pythagoreans; subsists at the
extremity of the <em>intelligible</em> triad, as is most satisfactorily
shown by Proclus in the third book of his Treatise On the
Theology, and in the fourth book of his Commentary On the
Timæus of Plato. But the Demiurgus, as it is demonstrated
by the same incomparable man, in the fifth book of
the former of these works, subsists at the extremity of the
<em>intellectual</em> triad. And between these two triads another
order of Gods exists, which is denominated <em>intelligible, and
at the same time intellectual</em>, as partaking of both the extremes.
The English reader who has a genius for such speculations,
will be convinced of this by diligently perusing my
translations of the above mentioned works. Notwithstanding,
however, the knowledge of Hierocles was not so consummately
accurate on certain most abstruse theological
dogmas as that of Iamblichus, Proclus, and Damascius, yet
where ethics are concerned, his notions are most correct,
most admirable, and sublime.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_10" href="#FNanchor_10" class="label">[10]</a> Thus, too, Plato in his Laws mingles his polity from a
democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy. He was, however,
decidedly of opinion, as is evident from his Politicus, that
the best form of government is that in which either one
man, who is a most excellent character, is the supreme ruler,
or a few excellent men rule conjointly.</p>

subsist about the irrational part of the soul, which
consists, according to them, as well as according to Plato,
of <em>anger</em> and <em>desire</em>. Hence Metopus, the Pythagorean,
says: “Since there are two parts of the soul, the rational
and the irrational, the latter is divided into the irascible and
the appetitive. And the rational part, indeed, is that by
which we judge and contemplate; but the irrational part is
that by which we are impelled and desire.” See my translation

have observed in my Notes to Iamblichus on the Mysteries,
divine flexibility indicates in Homer, and other theological
poets of antiquity, that those who through depravity become
unadapted to receive the illuminations of the Gods, when
they afterwards obtain pardon of their guilt through prayers
and sacrifices, again become partakers of the goodness of the
Gods. So that divine flexibility is a resumption of the participation
of divine light and goodness, by those who through

or is in a part, so that a part, also, becomes a whole according
to participation. A city, therefore, is a whole consisting of
parts, any part of which being absent, diminishes the whole.

by Moor in his Hindu Pantheon, p. 421, demonstrates the
great antiquity of this precept:</p>

<p>“Our divine religion has no need of such aids as many
are willing to give it; by asserting that the wisest men of
this world were ignorant of the two great maxims—that <em>we
must act in respect of others as we should wish them to act in
respect of ourselves</em>—and that, <em>instead of returning evil for
evil, we should confer benefits on those who injure us</em>. But
the first rule is implied in a speech of Lysias, and expressed
in distinct phrases by Thales and Pittacus; and I have even
seen it word for word, in the original of Confucius, which I
carefully compared with the Latin translation. If the conversion,
therefore, of the <em>Pandits</em> and <em>Maulavis</em>, in India,
shall ever be attempted by protestant missionaries, they must
beware of asserting, while they teach the gospel, what those
<em>Pandits</em> and <em>Maulavis</em> would know to be false. The former
would cite the beautiful <cite>Arya</cite> couplet, which was written at
least three centuries before our era, and which pronounce
the duty of a good man, even in the moment of destruction,
to consist, <em>not only in forgiving, but even in a desire of benefiting
his destroyer</em>—as <em>the sandal tree, in the instant of its
overthrow, sheds perfume on the axe which fells it</em>. And the
latter would triumph, in repeating the verse of <span class="smcap">Sadi</span>, who
represents <em>a return of good for good as a slight reciprocity</em>;
but says to the virtuous man, ‘<em>Confer benefits on him who
has injured thee</em>:’ using an <em>Arabic</em> sentence, and a maxim
apparently of the ancient Arabs. Nor would the <em>Mussulmans</em>
fail to recite four distichs of <em>Hafiz</em>, who has illustrated
that maxim with fanciful but elegant allusions:—</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">[49]</a> Hence Diogenes, in perfect conformity with that dignified
independence of character which he so eminently possessed,
and which is to be found more or less in the conduct
of all the ancient philosophers, when a certain wealthy and
ostentatious man brought him to a fine house which he had
built, and desired him not to spit, as he perceived he begun
to hawk, spit in the man’s face, observing at the same time,
that he could not find a worse place to spit in.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="label">[51]</a> This admirable passage is so conformable to the following
beautiful lines in Pope’s Essay on Man, that it is most
probably the source from whence they were derived. The
lines are these:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Self love but serves the virtuous mind to wake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As the small pebble stirs the peaceful lake,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The centre moved, a circle straight succeeds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Another still, and still another spreads,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Friend, parent, neighbour first it will embrace,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His country next, and next all human race;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wide and more wide <ins class="corr" id="tn-107" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the’ o’erflowings'">
                               th’ o’erflowings</ins> of the mind,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Take every creature in of every kind.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In Hierocles, however, the circles are scientifically detailed;
but in Pope they are synoptically enumerated.
Pope, too, has added another circle to that which is the
outermost with Hierocles, viz. the circle which embraces
every creature of every kind. But as Hierocles in this fragment
is only speaking of our duties to kindred, among which
the whole human race is, in a certain respect, included, he
had no occasion to introduce another circle, though the Platonic
doctrine of benevolence is as widely extended as that
of Pope.</p>

<p>As the selflove, however, mentioned here by our poet is
of a virtuous nature, and is wholly different from that selflove
which is reprehensible, and is possessed by the vulgar, I
shall present the reader with what Aristotle says concerning
the former in the 9th book of his Nicomachean Ethics, as
the distinction between the two is at present but little known.</p>

<p>Aristotle, therefore, having observed, that the selflove of
the multitude leads them to distribute to themselves the
greater part in wealth and honours, and corporeal pleasures,
and that in consequence of vindicating to themselves more
of these things than is fit, they are subservient to desires
and passions, and the irrational part of the soul, adds as
follows:</p>

<p>“He who always earnestly endeavours to act justly or
temperately, or to act according to any other of the virtues,
the most of all things, and, in short, who always vindicates
to himself that which is beautiful in conduct; such a man
will never be called by any one a lover of himself, nor will
he be blamed by any one. It would seem, however, that
such a man as this is, in a greater degree, a lover of himself;
for he distributes to himself things which are most eminently
beautiful and good, is gratified in his most principal part [intellect],
and in all things is obedient to it. But as that which
is the most principal thing in a city appears to be most eminently
the city, and this is the case in every other system of
things; thus, also, that which is most principal in man is
especially the man. He, therefore, who loves this principal
part of himself, is especially a lover of himself, and is gratified
with this. That every man, therefore, is principally intellect,
and that the worthy man principally loves this is not
immanifest. Hence, he will be especially a lover of himself,
according to a different species of selflove from that
which is disgraceful, and differing as much from it as to live
according to reason differs from living according to passion,
and as much as the desire of that which is beautiful in conduct
differs from the desire of that which appears to be advantageous.
Hence it is necessary that a good man should
be a lover of himself; for he himself is benefited by acting
well, and he also benefits others. But it is not proper that
a depraved man should be a lover of himself; for he will
hurt both himself and his neighbours, in consequence of
being subservient to base passions. With the depraved man,
therefore, there is a dissonance between what he ought to do
and what he does; but <em>with the worthy man, those things
which he ought to do he also does</em>.”</p>

<p>Conformably to what Aristotle asserts in this last sentence,
Seneca also says, “<span lang="la">Sapiens nihil facit quod non debet, et
nihil prætermittit quod debet.</span>” i.e. “<em>The wise man does
nothing which he ought not to do, and omits nothing which he
ought to do.</em>”</p>
